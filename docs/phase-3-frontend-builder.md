# Phase 3 ‚Äì Frontend Builder Core

## Goal
Deliver the new session builder experience with autosave, AI integration, live preview scaffolding, and foundational UI primitives.

## Inputs
- Phase 2 backend APIs and domain contracts
- Updated routing strategy (Phase 1)
- Design goals from blueprint overview

## Core Tasks
1. **Routing & Shell**
   - Configure app routes: `/sessions/builder/:sessionId`, `/sessions`, `/incentives`, `/topics`, etc.
   - Establish authenticated layout with sidebar linking to builder-first flows.
2. **State Management**
   - Implement builder state machine (XState or custom) handling draft loading, field edits, autosave timers, AI request lifecycle, error handling.
   - Create React context/hooks for session data, AI content versions, and readiness status.
3. **Builder UI Composition**
   - Layout with dual-pane view (form vs preview) and responsive mobile fallback.
   - Core panels: `SessionMetadataForm`, `AIComposer`, `ArtifactsPreview`, `QuickAddModal`.
   - Shared component kit (buttons, inputs, cards, tabs, progress bar, toast) under `frontend/src/ui`.
4. **Autosave & Versioning**
   - Debounce form changes, call backend autosave endpoint, surface status indicator.
   - Display AI content history (versions from backend) with ability to preview/restore.
5. **AI Interaction**
   - Prompt editor seeded from session fields.
   - ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù, ‚ÄúRegenerate‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTweak + Regen‚Äù actions wired to backend stub.
   - Accept/reject UI for AI content blocks; accepted content updates readiness score.
6. **Live Preview Scaffold**
   - Render landing page preview using session data + AI content.
   - Include toggle for layout variants (even if placeholders now).
   - Provide placeholder for trainer kit summary.
7. **Accessibility & UX Guardrails**
   - Keyboard navigation, focus management, aria labels for interactive controls.
   - Autosave toast with undo option (client-side revert).

## Deliverables
- Functional builder route with core workflows operating against backend stubs.
- Shared UI component library powering builder and future pages.
- Documentation (`docs/frontend-builder.md`) describing architecture and component map.

## Backend Touchpoints
- `POST /sessions/builder/:id/autosave` ‚Äì persists draft metadata, outline snapshot, AI prompt, versions, and accepted selection. Returns `{ savedAt: ISODateString }`; backend stores payload in JSONB column and echoes timestamp used to update the autosave indicator.
- `GET /sessions/builder/:id/complete-data` ‚Äì hydrates the builder with latest persisted draft plus session metadata; must include autosave payload shape so local drafts merge cleanly.
- `POST /sessions/builder/suggest-outline` ‚Äì returns `SessionOutline` structure (`sections[]`, totals, descriptions). Until backend stabilises, the frontend keeps a mock fallback, but once live this endpoint becomes the single source of truth.
- Future-phase routes (templates, training/marketing kits) should remain no-ops or guarded until their implementations land to avoid breaking the Phase 3 handoff.

## Test Plan
1. **Automated Frontend Tests**
   - `npm run test --workspace=packages/frontend` (unit + component) must pass.
   - Add component tests for state machine behaviors (autosave, AI request states).
2. **Playwright Smoke (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Create a basic script that loads the builder, edits fields, triggers autosave, and requests AI content (mocked response).
3. **Manual QA Checklist**
   - Verify autosave indicator updates correctly when offline/online.
   - Check responsive layout (desktop vs mobile) and keyboard accessibility.
   - Ensure AI content acceptance updates readiness meter.
4. **Documentation Verification**
   - Confirm UI docs list component locations and usage guidelines.

## Status Notes (2025-09-26)
- Builder routes now live under protected navigation with `/sessions/builder` redirecting to `/sessions/builder/:sessionId` and the shell delivered through `BuilderLayout` (`packages/frontend/src/App.tsx`, `packages/frontend/src/pages/SessionBuilderPage.tsx`).
- `SessionBuilderProvider` manages hydration from backend/local storage, autosave debounce + undo, readiness scoring, and AI generation fallbacks inside one reducer-driven context (`packages/frontend/src/features/session-builder/state/SessionBuilderContext.tsx`).
- Dual-pane workspace composed of `SessionMetadataForm`, `AIComposer`, `ArtifactsPreview`, `QuickAddModal`, and `AutosaveIndicator` is wired to the provider and backed by the shared UI primitives (`packages/frontend/src/features/session-builder/components/*`).
- UI toolkit (`packages/frontend/src/ui`) provides buttons, tabs, progress, toast, and form inputs consumed across the builder, with `ToastProvider` enabling autosave/error messaging on the page.
- Reducer unit tests cover AI lifecycle, autosave success/failure, acceptance, and restore flows (`packages/frontend/src/features/session-builder/state/__tests__/builderReducer.test.ts`).

## Outstanding Gaps
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Playwright smoke test created (`tests/e2e/session-builder-smoke.spec.ts`) covering core builder workflow
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Component test coverage added for key builder components (AutosaveIndicator, SessionMetadataForm, QuickAddModal)
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Accessibility and responsive behaviors documented in `docs/frontend-builder.md`
- Live preview tab shows scaffolded landing page/outline panels, while the trainer kit view remains a placeholder awaiting Phase 4 integrations.
- Autosave and AI endpoints expect the Phase 2 backend stubs; end-to-end verification against deployed services still needs to be completed.

## Handoff Checklist
- [x] ‚úÖ Builder route feature-complete for draft sessions.
- [x] ‚úÖ UI library exported for other modules.
- [x] ‚úÖ Tests green and Playwright smoke test created and documented.
- [x] ‚úÖ Known gaps captured in this document and `docs/phase-issues.md`.
- [x] ‚úÖ Autosave endpoint integrated; SessionBuilderProvider handles backend/fallback gracefully.
- [x] ‚úÖ Component test coverage added for critical builder components.
- [x] ‚úÖ Accessibility and responsive behavior documented.
- [x] ‚úÖ Core session builder workflow functional with autosave, AI integration, and preview.
