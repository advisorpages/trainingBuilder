# Phase 5 â€“ AI Experience & Quality Gates

## Goal
Polish AI interactions, enforce publish readiness, and harden the platform with comprehensive validation, analytics, and documentation.

## Inputs
- Functional builder and supporting modules (Phases 1-4)
- AI abstraction layer (Phase 2)
- UX enhancements list from blueprint

## Core Tasks
1. **AI Prompt & Response Enhancements**
   - Implement contextual prompt suggestions based on session metadata and past successes.
   - Add moderation/quality checks for AI outputs (tone, length, banned phrases) before acceptance.
   - Enable inline editing with diff view between AI and human edits.
2. **Publish Readiness Engine**
   - Calculate readiness score from required fields, AI acceptance, landing page status, trainer assignment, and incentive linkage.
   - Gate publish actions behind readiness threshold; provide actionable checklist.
3. **Undo & Version Controls**
   - Surface content version timeline with restore/compare actions.
   - Add undo/redo controls for recent AI-generated blocks.
4. **Analytics & Telemetry**
   - Capture key events (prompt submissions, rejections, publishes) for future insights.
   - Display builder usage stats in `/analytics` dashboard (basic charts acceptable).
5. **Accessibility & Performance Polish**
   - Audit via Lighthouse/axe; address WCAG AA gaps.
   - Optimize bundle splitting and lazy loading for builder and public pages.
6. **Documentation & Onboarding**
   - Update README, PRD v2, and create `docs/ai-guidelines.md` for working with the AI module.
   - Add developer onboarding checklist and architecture diagram reflecting final system.

## Deliverables
- Enhanced AI builder interactions with guardrails and undo.
- Publish readiness scoring integrated into UI and backend policies.
- Analytics telemetry surfaced in dashboards.
- Finalized documentation set.

## Test Plan
1. **Automated & Regression Tests**
   - Extend unit tests for readiness calculations and AI moderation logic.
   - Update Playwright end-to-end suite to cover readiness gating and undo/redo.
   - Run `npm run test:ci` at repo root (backend + frontend + e2e) and ensure green.
2. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Use axe (browser extension or `@axe-core/react`) on builder and public pages; resolve critical violations.
   - Keyboard navigation audit (no mouse) capturing findings in QA log.
3. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Lighthouse on builder and public pages (mobile + desktop). Target >=90 Performance/Accessibility where feasible.
4. **Telemetry Verification**
   - Check analytics events recorded (in console/log) when generating AI content, accepting output, publishing session.

## Handoff Checklist
- [ ] CI pipeline green with expanded coverage.
- [ ] Accessibility/performance reports attached to docs.
- [ ] Analytics dashboards populated with sample data.
- [ ] Final documentation reviewed and linked from README.
