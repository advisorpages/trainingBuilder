# Epic 7: Analytics & Reporting Dashboard - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Build a comprehensive analytics dashboard that provides Content Developers and leadership with actionable insights into training session performance, attendance trends, and trainer effectiveness to enable data-driven decision making.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Complete session lifecycle (creation, publishing, registration), trainer dashboard, user authentication with role-based access, dynamic grid dashboard layout
- Technology stack: React/TypeScript frontend with Vite, Node.js/NestJS backend with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database
- Integration points: Existing session and registration data, authentication middleware, dashboard grid components, existing API patterns

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: New analytics dashboard with visual charts, metrics tracking, and reporting capabilities that leverages existing session and registration data
- How it integrates: Extends existing dashboard with new analytics section, reuses authentication system, queries existing database tables, follows established UI patterns
- Success criteria: Content Developers can view session performance metrics, attendance trends, trainer statistics, and export reports in under 30 seconds

## Stories

1. **Story 7.1:** Analytics Dashboard UI - Create analytics dashboard shell with navigation and basic metrics cards following existing dynamic grid patterns
2. **Story 7.2:** Session Performance Analytics - Implement session metrics (attendance rates, registration trends, popular topics) with interactive charts and filters
3. **Story 7.3:** Data Export & Reporting - Add export functionality for analytics data in CSV/PDF formats with customizable date ranges and filters

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new analytics endpoints only)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (read-only queries on existing tables)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (dynamic grid layout, existing component library)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (efficient queries with proper indexing)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Complex database queries could impact performance of existing session/registration operations
- **Mitigation:** Use read replicas or optimized read-only queries with proper indexing; implement caching for expensive analytics calculations
- **Rollback Plan:** Analytics features are purely additive - can be disabled via feature flags without affecting core functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (session creation, registration, trainer dashboard)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly with no performance impact on core features
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (API docs for new analytics endpoints)
- [ ] No regression in existing features - comprehensive performance testing completed

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running React/TypeScript frontend with Node.js/NestJS backend and PostgreSQL database
- Integration points: Existing session and registration database tables, authentication middleware (JWT with role-based access), dashboard dynamic grid components, existing API patterns
- Existing patterns to follow: Dynamic grid dashboard layout, existing component library, API endpoint patterns, data visualization should use established charting libraries
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must integrate with existing Content Developer role permissions, read-only access to existing data tables, maintain performance of core session/registration operations, follow established UI/UX patterns
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact and performant (session creation, registration processing, trainer dashboard)

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering comprehensive analytics capabilities that provide actionable insights for Content Developers and leadership."
