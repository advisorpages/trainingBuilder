# Story 6.3: One-Step AI Content Generation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** a streamlined one-step AI content generation process for incentives,
**so that** I can quickly create compelling promotional copy without the multi-step prompt review process used for sessions.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Incentive worksheet UI (Story 6.1), incentive draft system (Story 6.2), existing AI service (Story 2.3)
- Technology: React frontend, Express backend with AI integration, existing AI service abstraction layer
- Follows pattern: AI service integration patterns from session creation, but simplified workflow
- Touch points: Incentive data, existing AI service, content generation templates

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. System generates AI content directly from incentive worksheet data in single step
2. Content generation produces title, description, and promotional copy for incentives
3. Generated content incorporates incentive details (rules, dates, audience, tone)
4. Content Developer can regenerate content with different parameters
5. Generated content can be edited before saving to draft
6. System provides multiple content variations (e.g., short/long descriptions, different tones)

**Integration Requirements:**

7. AI content generation integrates seamlessly with incentive worksheet workflow
8. Reuses existing AI service infrastructure from session AI generation
9. Generated content follows consistent template structure optimized for incentives
10. Integration maintains all incentive data relationships and validation

**Quality Requirements:**

11. Content generation is fast and provides clear loading indicators
12. Generated content is high-quality and relevant to incentive details
13. Interface follows existing admin design patterns from session AI workflow

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing AI service to support incentive content generation with simplified, direct workflow
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Leverage AI service from Story 2.3 but streamline for single-step generation
- **Key Constraints:** Must reuse existing AI infrastructure; optimized for speed over customization compared to session workflow

## Dev Notes

### AI Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 6 goals, existing AI service from Story 2.3]

**Incentive Content Types Needed:**
- Promotional title (catchy, urgent)
- Short description (elevator pitch)
- Long description (detailed value proposition)
- Rules summary (clear, concise)
- Social media copy (shareable, engaging)
- Email marketing copy (professional, compelling)

**AI Service Integration:**
- Reuse existing OpenAI integration and rate limiting
- Simplified prompt templates optimized for promotional content
- Single-step generation (no prompt review like sessions)
- Focus on speed and ease of use
- Response parsing for multiple content types

### Workflow Integration
[Source: Stories 6.1, 6.2 incentive worksheet flow]

**Integration Points:**
- Embedded within incentive worksheet (not separate step like sessions)
- Triggered on-demand by Content Developer
- Maintains incentive context throughout generation
- Links directly to draft save workflow
- Optional step (Content Developer can skip and create manually)

**User Experience Flow:**
1. Complete incentive worksheet (Story 6.1)
2. **Optionally generate AI content (this story)**
3. Edit generated content if desired
4. Save as draft (Story 6.2)

### Content Generation Specifications

**Prompt Context for Incentives:**
- Incentive title and basic description
- Rules and restrictions
- Start and end dates (urgency factor)
- Target audience information
- Tone preferences
- Category context

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "title": "Generated promotional title",
  "shortDescription": "Elevator pitch version",
  "longDescription": "Detailed value proposition",
  "rulesText": "Simplified rules explanation",
  "socialCopy": "Social media version",
  "emailCopy": "Email marketing version"
}
```

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can quickly generate high-quality promotional content for incentives in a single step, with the option to edit and refine before saving to draft.
