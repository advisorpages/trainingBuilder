# Story 5.3: Registration Form & Local Capture

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** potential training session attendee,
**I want** my registration information to be immediately captured and saved locally,
**so that** my registration is secured even if external systems are temporarily unavailable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Registration form submissions are immediately saved to local database (registrations table)
2. Form validates required fields (name, email) before submission
3. Email field validates proper email format
4. "Referred by" field is optional and accepts free text input
5. Upon successful local save, user sees immediate confirmation message
6. Registration records are created with sync_status of "pending"
7. Form handles and displays appropriate error messages for validation failures
8. Form prevents duplicate registrations for same email/session combination
9. Registration timestamp (created_at) is automatically recorded
10. Form submission is processed asynchronously to maintain responsive UI
11. System gracefully handles database connection issues with user-friendly error messages

  - [x] Display system error messages for database or connection issues
  - [x] Clear form state after successful submission
  - [x] Provide clear next steps in confirmation message

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
Story 5.2 created the dynamic session page with the registration form UI. This story focuses on the backend data capture functionality that feeds into the two-stage registration system (local capture → webhook sync in Story 5.4).

**Data Models:**
- Registrations table with fields: id, session_id, name, email, referred_by, created_at, sync_status [Source: architecture.md#feature-tables]
- sync_status values: "pending" (initial state), "synced" (after webhook success), "failed" (after webhook failure)
- Sessions table for session validation and registration capacity checking
- Database constraints to prevent duplicate email registrations per session

**API Specifications:**
- POST /sessions/{id}/register: Public endpoint for capturing registration data
- Request body: { name: string, email: string, referred_by?: string }
- Response: { success: boolean, message: string, registration_id?: number }
- Validates session exists, is published, and accepting registrations
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 400, 409, 500)

**Component Specifications:**
- Enhanced RegistrationForm component from Story 5.2
- Form validation using standard HTML5 validation plus custom email validation
- Async form submission with loading states and error handling
- Integration with existing React/TypeScript patterns from session page

**File Locations:**
- Registration form component: packages/frontend/src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx (enhance existing)
- Registration service: packages/frontend/src/services/registrationService.ts
- Backend controller: packages/backend/src/modules/sessions/sessions.controller.ts
- Registration entity: packages/backend/src/modules/sessions/entities/registration.entity.ts
- Registration DTO: packages/backend/src/modules/sessions/dto/create-registration.dto.ts

**Technical Constraints:**
- Local capture must be fast and reliable [Source: NFR5 background sync requirements]
- Two-stage registration system: local capture (this story) → webhook sync (Story 5.4)
- Database integrity with proper error handling and duplicate prevention
- Responsive UI with non-blocking form submissions
- Graceful degradation when external systems unavailable

**Integration Points:**
- Registration form UI from Story 5.2 (dynamic session page)
- Database schema from Story 1.2 (registrations table)
- Feeds into Story 5.4 (asynchronous webhook sync)
- Session validation from Epic 3 publishing workflow

**Database Schema Reference:**
```sql
registrations table:
- id (PK, auto-increment)
- session_id (FK to sessions.id)
- name (varchar, required)
- email (varchar, required)
- referred_by (varchar, optional)
- created_at (timestamp, auto)
- sync_status (enum: pending, synced, failed)
```

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for registration form validation logic
- Integration tests for POST /sessions/{id}/register endpoint
- Database transaction testing for data integrity
- Error handling tests for all failure scenarios
- Form submission flow end-to-end testing

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Valid registration data saves successfully to database
- Email validation prevents invalid email formats
- Duplicate email registration returns appropriate error
- Invalid session ID returns 404 error
- Database connection failures handled gracefully
- Form validation displays appropriate error messages
- Success confirmation appears after valid submission
- Loading states work correctly during submission
