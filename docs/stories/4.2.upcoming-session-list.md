# Story 4.2: Upcoming Session List

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Trainer,
**I want** to see a list of my upcoming training sessions for the next 7 days,
**so that** I can prepare for my assignments and manage my schedule effectively.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Trainer dashboard shell (Story 4.1), session management, trainer entities
- Technology: React frontend with TypeScript, NestJS backend API
- Follows pattern: Session listing patterns from existing session management
- Touch points: Session entity, Trainer entity, user authentication, session status

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Trainer can view list of sessions assigned to them in the next 7 days
2. Session list displays key information: title, date, time, location, status
3. Session cards show participant registration count if available
4. List is sorted chronologically with earliest sessions first
5. Empty state message shown when no upcoming sessions exist
6. Session cards include action buttons to view detailed session information

**Data Requirements:**

7. Only published sessions are shown by default in upcoming sessions list
8. Sessions are filtered by trainer assignment (trainerId matches current user's trainer)
9. Date range filtering shows sessions with startTime within next 7 days
10. Real-time data fetching from trainer dashboard API endpoints

**Integration Requirements:**

11. Session list integrates with trainer dashboard shell layout
12. Clicking session cards navigates to detailed session view
13. Loading and error states handled appropriately

**Quality Requirements:**

14. List follows existing design patterns and responsive layouts
15. Performance optimized for trainers with many assigned sessions
16. Graceful handling of network errors and data loading states

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend trainer dashboard with session list component
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow session listing patterns from manage sessions interface
- **Key Constraints:** Must filter by trainer assignment; real-time data synchronization
