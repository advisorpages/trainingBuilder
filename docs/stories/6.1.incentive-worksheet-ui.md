# Story 6.1: Incentive Worksheet UI

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Incentive worksheet UI implemented with comprehensive form functionality

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** a comprehensive incentive worksheet interface,
**so that** I can input all incentive details and configure options for AI content generation following the same patterns as session creation.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Authentication system (Story 1.3), session worksheet patterns (Story 2.1), existing dashboard navigation
- Technology: React frontend with TypeScript, Express backend API, existing form validation patterns
- Follows pattern: Session worksheet UI layout, form state management, dynamic grid dashboard integration
- Touch points: Incentive entity, user authentication, existing form components and styling patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can access incentive creation worksheet from authenticated dashboard
2. Form includes all incentive basic details (title, description, rules, start date, end date)
3. Form includes selections for target audience, tone, category (reusing existing attribute tables)
4. Form includes AI generation settings and preferences configuration similar to sessions
5. Form validation prevents submission with missing required fields
6. Real-time form validation provides immediate feedback to user

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Existing authentication system controls access to worksheet (Content Developer role only)
8. Worksheet populates dropdowns from existing attribute management data (audiences, tones, categories)
9. Integration with existing admin interface navigation and styling patterns
10. Incentive worksheet appears in dashboard navigation alongside session worksheet

**Quality Requirements:**

11. Form follows existing design patterns and responsive layouts from session worksheet
12. Form state is preserved during navigation (draft auto-save capability)
13. No regression in existing admin functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create new incentive worksheet page within existing admin interface structure, parallel to session worksheet
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow form patterns from session worksheet UI (Story 2.1) and existing admin interfaces
- **Key Constraints:** Must integrate with existing attribute data; form state management for draft workflow; consistent UI/UX with session creation

## Dev Notes

### Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 6 details, existing session worksheet patterns]

**Required Data Integrations:**
- Current user authentication and role verification
- Audiences, tones, categories from attribute management (reuse existing tables)
- Existing form validation and state management patterns

**Form Fields Required:**
**Basic Incentive Details:**
- Title (text, required)
- Description (textarea, required)
- Rules (textarea, required)
- Start Date (date picker, required)
- End Date (date picker, required, must be after start date)

**Selection Fields:**
- Target Audience (dropdown from audiences table)
- Tone (dropdown from tones table)
- Category (dropdown from categories table)

**AI Generation Settings:**
- Additional context notes (textarea, optional)
- Content preferences (checkboxes/toggles)
- Generation parameters (advanced settings)

### Existing System Context
**Admin Interface Patterns to Follow:**
- React components in packages/frontend/src/pages/admin/
- Session worksheet layout and form patterns
- Consistent form layouts and validation patterns
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- API integration patterns from existing admin pages

**Authentication Integration:**
- Role-based route protection
- Content Developer role required
- Existing auth context and guards

### Database Schema Considerations
**New Incentive Entity (to be created in Story 6.2):**
- Will require new incentive table with fields matching form requirements
- Relationships to existing attribute tables (audiences, tones, categories)
- User ownership (author_id foreign key to users table)
- Status field for draft/published lifecycle

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can access and use a comprehensive incentive worksheet that integrates seamlessly with existing systems and follows established interface patterns from the session worksheet.
