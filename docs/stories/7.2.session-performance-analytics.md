# Story 7.2: Session Performance Analytics

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented with interactive charts and analytics

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to view detailed session performance metrics with interactive charts and filtering options,
**so that** I can analyze attendance trends, identify popular topics, and optimize future training sessions based on data-driven insights.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Analytics dashboard UI (Story 7.1), session management system (Epic 2), registration system (Epic 5), trainer management (Epic 1)
- Technology: React frontend with chart visualization library, Express backend with analytics calculations, PostgreSQL with optimized read queries
- Follows pattern: Dashboard component architecture, data visualization standards, filtering/search patterns from existing features
- Touch points: Session data analysis, registration metrics, trainer performance tracking, topic popularity trends

## Acceptance Criteria

**Chart Visualization Requirements:**

1. Analytics dashboard displays session attendance rate chart with line graph showing trends over selected time period
2. Bar chart shows session registration counts grouped by month/week/day based on selected date range
3. Pie chart displays session distribution by topic showing most/least popular training subjects
4. Horizontal bar chart shows trainer performance with session counts and average attendance rates
5. All charts are interactive with hover tooltips showing detailed data points and percentages
6. Charts automatically update when date range filter is changed from Story 7.1

**Filtering and Analysis Requirements:**

7. Content Developer can filter analytics by specific trainer using dropdown selector
8. Session status filter allows viewing analytics for published, draft, or all sessions
9. Topic filter enables analysis of specific training subjects or topic combinations
10. Location filter shows performance metrics by training venue
11. Attendance threshold filter highlights sessions above/below specified attendance rates
12. Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously with clear filter state display

**Performance Metrics Requirements:**

13. Dashboard shows session completion rate (sessions that occurred vs scheduled sessions)
14. Registration-to-attendance conversion rate displayed with trend indicators
15. Average session capacity utilization percentage with visual progress indicators
16. Peak registration times analysis showing optimal scheduling insights
17. Session cancellation rate tracking with reasons categorization
18. Trainer workload distribution showing session assignments across time periods

**Data Detail Requirements:**

19. Detailed session list view with sortable columns for all key metrics
20. Individual session drill-down showing registration timeline, attendee demographics
21. Comparative analysis showing session performance against historical averages
22. Trend analysis highlighting improving/declining performance patterns
23. Alert indicators for sessions with unusually low registration or attendance
24. Data freshness indicator showing when analytics were last updated

**User Experience Requirements:**

25. All charts render within 3 seconds with proper loading animations
26. Mobile-responsive chart design with touch-friendly interactions on tablets/phones
27. Charts maintain readability with appropriate font sizes and color contrast
28. Export chart images functionality for reports and presentations
29. Keyboard navigation support for accessibility compliance
30. Chart legends and labels provide clear data interpretation guidance

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Story 7.1 established dashboard shell, authentication, and basic KPI cards
- Session data structure and status tracking from Epic 2 stories provide foundation
- Registration system from Epic 5 provides attendance/registration correlation data
- Existing filtering patterns from dashboard features can be extended

**Data Models:**
- Primary tables: `sessions`, `registrations`, `trainers`, `topics`, `session_topics` [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]
- Session fields: `id`, `title`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `status`, `trainer_id`, `location_id` [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]
- Registration fields: `session_id`, `created_at`, `sync_status` for attendance tracking [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]
- Join operations needed for trainer names, topic names, location names [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]

**API Specifications:**
- GET `/admin/analytics/sessions/performance` - Session metrics with filtering parameters [Source: architecture/4-api-specification-high-level.md]
- GET `/admin/analytics/sessions/trends` - Time-series data for trend charts
- GET `/admin/analytics/trainers/performance` - Trainer-specific metrics and comparisons
- GET `/admin/analytics/topics/popularity` - Topic distribution and popularity metrics
- Query parameters: `startDate`, `endDate`, `trainerId`, `status`, `topicId`, `locationId`

**Component Specifications:**
- Chart library: Consider Recharts or Chart.js for React integration [Following tech-stack patterns]
- Component structure: `src/components/features/analytics/charts/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Filter components: `src/components/features/analytics/filters/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Use Shadcn/ui components for filters: Select, DatePicker, MultiSelect [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- React Query for data fetching with stale-while-revalidate caching [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**File Locations:**
- Chart components: `src/components/features/analytics/charts/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
