# Story 1.3: User Authentication

## Status
Done ✅

## Story
**As a** User (Broker, Content Developer, or Trainer),
**I want** a secure authentication system with role-based access control,
**so that** I can safely login and access features appropriate to my role while ensuring application security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. JWT-based authentication system implemented with secure token generation and validation
2. Login endpoint (`POST /auth/login`) accepts email/password and returns JWT token with user information
3. Role-based access control (RBAC) system enforces permissions for Broker, Content Developer, and Trainer roles
4. Authentication middleware protects all secured endpoints and validates JWT tokens
5. Password hashing implemented using bcrypt for secure credential storage
6. Frontend login form integrated with backend authentication API
7. Protected routes in frontend redirect unauthenticated users to login page
8. User session management with token refresh capability implemented
9. Logout functionality clears authentication state on both frontend and backend
10. Authentication state persisted across browser sessions with secure token storage

## Dev Notes

### Authentication Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#4-api-specification, prd.md#fr2, #nfr7]

**JWT Authentication System:**
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Role-based permissions for three user types:
  - **Broker**: Limited read access to published sessions
  - **Content Developer**: Full CRUD access to sessions, incentives, admin resources
  - **Trainer**: Read access to assigned sessions with detailed view
- Public endpoints: sessions list, session details, registration
- Protected endpoints: admin endpoints, trainer dashboard, content management

**Required Authentication Endpoints:**
- `POST /auth/login` - Public authentication endpoint
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh endpoint
- `POST /auth/logout` - Session termination endpoint
- `GET /auth/profile` - Current user profile information

**Security Requirements:**
[Source: prd.md#nfr4, architecture security considerations]
- Bcrypt password hashing with sufficient salt rounds
- JWT secret key management (environment variable)
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Role-based route protection
- Secure token storage with XSS/CSRF considerations
- Input validation and sanitization

### Database Integration Context
[Source: Story 1.2 completion, entities implementation]

**Available User/Role Entities:**
- User entity with role relationship established
- Role entity with predefined roles (ID 1: Broker, ID 2: Content Developer, ID 3: Trainer)
- Sample users created for each role with hashed passwords
- Database schema supports user authentication requirements

**Sample User Accounts Available:**
- Content Developers: sarah.content@company.com, mike.creator@company.com
- Trainers: john.trainer@company.com, lisa.coach@company.com
- Brokers: broker1@company.com, broker2@company.com

### Frontend Integration Requirements
[Source: Story 1.1 frontend setup, current routing]

**Existing Frontend Structure:**
- React Router setup with basic routes (/, /login, /dashboard)
- Login page placeholder exists but not functional
- Dashboard page needs role-based content
- Homepage needs authenticated vs public state

**Authentication Flow Requirements:**
- Login form with email/password validation
- Dashboard customization based on user role
- Navigation updates for authenticated state
- Protected route redirections to login
- Token-based API call authentication

### Technology Stack Integration
[Source: Story 1.1 dependencies, NestJS setup]

**Backend Dependencies Available:**
- @nestjs/passport, @nestjs/jwt already in package.json
- bcrypt, passport-jwt, passport-local dependencies available
- TypeORM entities ready for authentication integration
- NestJS module structure supports authentication module

**Frontend Dependencies Available:**
- React Router for protected routes
- Axios for authenticated API calls
- React state management for authentication context

### Testing Standards
**Authentication Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for authentication services and guards
- Integration tests for login/logout flow
- Role-based access control validation
- Token security and expiration testing
- Frontend authentication flow testing
- Cross-browser session persistence testing

**Security Testing:**
- Password hashing validation
- JWT token security verification
- Role permission boundary testing
- Authentication bypass attempt testing

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 1.2 completion]

**Completed Infrastructure:**
- Complete database schema with user/role tables
- TypeORM entities with relationships established
- Sample users created with placeholder password hashes
- Backend NestJS application with module structure
- Frontend React application with routing foundation

**Integration Points:**
- User and Role entities ready for authentication service
- Backend health checks operational for testing
- Frontend routing structure supports protected routes
- Docker environment ready for full stack testing
