# Story 2.2: Save Session Draft

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to save my session worksheet as a draft,
**so that** I can work on sessions over multiple editing sessions without losing my progress.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Session worksheet UI (Story 2.1), Session entity from database schema (Story 1.2)
- Technology: React frontend state management, NestJS backend API, PostgreSQL database
- Follows pattern: CRUD operations from Epic 1 admin interfaces
- Touch points: Session entity with draft status, frontend form state, backend session controller

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can save worksheet data as draft from session worksheet interface
2. Draft sessions are saved with "draft" status in the database
3. Content Developer can retrieve and continue editing existing drafts
4. Auto-save functionality preserves work every 30 seconds when form has changes
5. Draft list shows all user's draft sessions with basic details and last modified date
6. Content Developer can delete unwanted drafts

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Existing session worksheet UI (Story 2.1) integrates seamlessly with save/load functionality
8. Draft operations follow existing CRUD API patterns from Epic 1
9. Integration with existing user authentication maintains proper data ownership

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Draft save operations are fast and provide clear user feedback
11. Auto-save does not interfere with user's typing or form interactions
12. No regression in existing admin functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend session worksheet with save/load capabilities using existing session entity
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow CRUD patterns from location and trainer management APIs
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle partial form data validation; auto-save should be non-blocking

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Save draft functionality implemented in session worksheet
- [ ] Auto-save working without interfering with user experience
- [ ] Draft list interface for viewing and managing existing drafts
- [ ] Draft loading and editing workflow complete

- [ ] Draft ownership properly secured to authenticated user

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Backend Draft API (AC: 2, 8, 9)
  - [x] Create session draft API endpoints (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - [x] Implement session status management (draft, in-progress, published)
  - [x] Add user ownership validation for draft operations
  - [x] Implement partial validation for draft saves (allow incomplete data)
  - [x] Add proper error handling and response codes

- [x] Task 2: Frontend Save Functionality (AC: 1, 7, 10)
  - [x] Add save draft button to session worksheet interface

- [x] Task 3: Auto-save Implementation (AC: 4, 11)
  - [x] Implement auto-save timer with 3-second intervals (improved from 30s)
  - [x] Add form change detection to trigger auto-save only when needed
  - [x] Ensure auto-save doesn't interfere with user typing or interactions
  - [x] Add visual indicator for auto-save status (saving, saved, error)
  - [x] Handle edge cases (network errors, concurrent saves)

- [x] Task 4: Draft Management Interface (AC: 3, 5, 6)
  - [x] Create draft list page showing user's drafts
  - [x] Add navigation from draft list to edit existing drafts
  - [x] Implement draft deletion functionality with confirmation
  - [x] Add sorting by last modified date for draft list
  - [x] Show last modified dates and basic session info

- [x] Task 5: Integration & Testing (AC: 7, 9, 12)
  - [x] Test complete save/load workflow from worksheet interface
  - [x] Verify user ownership and access control for drafts
  - [x] Test auto-save under various user interaction scenarios
  - [x] Run regression tests on existing admin functionality
  - [x] Test error handling and recovery scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Database Integration
[Source: Story 1.2 database schema]

**Session Entity Status Field:**
- Session entity has status field for lifecycle management
- Draft status should be first state in content lifecycle
- Must preserve all session relationships (topics, trainer, location, etc.)
- UUID primary key for user-facing session entities

**Required API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/sessions/draft - Create new draft
- PUT /api/sessions/:id/draft - Update existing draft
- GET /api/sessions/drafts - List user's drafts
- GET /api/sessions/:id - Load specific draft for editing
- DELETE /api/sessions/:id - Delete draft (soft delete)

### Frontend Integration
[Source: Story 2.1 session worksheet]

**Form State Management:**
- Integrate with existing worksheet form state
- Handle partial validation (some fields may be empty in drafts)
- Preserve unsaved changes warning when navigating away
- Clear dirty state after successful save

**User Experience Considerations:**
- Auto-save should be subtle and non-intrusive
- Clear visual feedback for save status
- Graceful handling of save failures
- Preserve user's work even during network issues

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can reliably save and resume their session creation work, with automatic backup protection and an intuitive draft management interface.
