# Story 6.2: Save Incentive Draft

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Incentive draft functionality implemented with auto-save and manual save capabilities

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to save my incentive worksheet as a draft,
**so that** I can work on incentives over multiple editing sessions without losing my progress, following the same patterns as session drafts.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Incentive worksheet UI (Story 6.1), existing session draft patterns (Story 2.2), database schema
- Technology: React frontend state management, Express backend API, PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Follows pattern: Session draft CRUD operations, existing database patterns
- Touch points: New incentive entity with draft status, frontend form state, backend incentive controller

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can save worksheet data as draft from incentive worksheet interface
2. Draft incentives are saved with "draft" status in the database
3. Content Developer can retrieve and continue editing existing drafts
4. Auto-save functionality preserves work every 3 seconds when form has changes (following session pattern)
5. Draft list shows all user's draft incentives with basic details and last modified date
6. Content Developer can delete unwanted drafts

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Existing incentive worksheet UI (Story 6.1) integrates seamlessly with save/load functionality
8. Draft operations follow existing CRUD API patterns from sessions and Epic 1
9. Integration with existing user authentication maintains proper data ownership
10. Incentive drafts appear in dashboard alongside session drafts

**Quality Requirements:**

11. Draft save operations are fast and provide clear user feedback
12. Auto-save does not interfere with user's typing or form interactions
13. No regression in existing admin functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create new incentive entity and extend incentive worksheet with save/load capabilities using session draft patterns
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow CRUD patterns from session draft API (Story 2.2) and existing admin interfaces
- **Key Constraints:** Must handle partial form data validation; auto-save should be non-blocking; date validation for incentive periods

  - [ ] Handle edge cases (network errors, concurrent saves)

- [ ] Task 5: Draft Management Interface (AC: 3, 5, 6, 10)
  - [ ] Extend existing draft list to include incentive drafts
  - [ ] Add navigation from draft list to edit existing incentive drafts
  - [ ] Implement incentive draft deletion functionality with confirmation
  - [ ] Add sorting by last modified date for draft list
  - [ ] Show last modified dates and basic incentive info

- [ ] Task 6: Integration & Testing (AC: 7, 9, 10, 13)
  - [ ] Test complete save/load workflow from incentive worksheet interface
  - [ ] Verify user ownership and access control for incentive drafts
  - [ ] Test auto-save under various user interaction scenarios
  - [ ] Run regression tests on existing admin functionality
  - [ ] Test error handling and recovery scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Database Integration
[Source: Existing session draft patterns, Epic 6 requirements]

**New Incentive Entity Schema:**
```sql
incentives {
  id: UUID (PK)
  title: VARCHAR
  description: TEXT
  rules: TEXT
  start_date: DATE
  end_date: DATE
  status: ENUM (draft, published)
  author_id: UUID (FK to users)
  audience_id: UUID (FK to audiences)
  tone_id: UUID (FK to tones)
  category_id: UUID (FK to categories)
  created_at: TIMESTAMP
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```

**Required API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/incentives/draft - Create new incentive draft
- PUT /api/incentives/:id/draft - Update existing incentive draft
- GET /api/incentives/drafts - List user's incentive drafts
- GET /api/incentives/:id - Load specific incentive draft for editing
- DELETE /api/incentives/:id - Delete incentive draft

### Frontend Integration
[Source: Story 6.1 incentive worksheet, existing session draft patterns]

**Form State Management:**
- Integrate with existing incentive worksheet form state
- Handle partial validation (some fields may be empty in drafts)
- Preserve unsaved changes warning when navigating away
- Clear dirty state after successful save
- Date validation (end date must be after start date)

**User Experience Considerations:**
- Auto-save should be subtle and non-intrusive
- Clear visual feedback for save status
- Graceful handling of save failures
- Preserve user's work even during network issues
- Consistent with session draft experience

### Integration with Existing Systems
**Dashboard Integration:**
- Extend existing draft list to show both session and incentive drafts
- Consistent card layout and navigation patterns
- Type indicators to distinguish incentive vs session drafts

**API Consistency:**
- Follow same authentication patterns as session drafts
- Use same error handling and response patterns
- Maintain same auto-save timing and behavior

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can reliably save and resume their incentive creation work, with automatic backup protection and an intuitive draft management interface that integrates seamlessly with existing session draft functionality.
