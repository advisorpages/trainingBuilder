# Story 7.1: Analytics Dashboard UI

## Status
COMPLETED

## Dev Notes
- Implemented the basic UI for the analytics dashboard, including the page component, a reusable KPI card component, and the overall layout.
- Integrated the frontend with the backend API to fetch and display analytics data.
- Implemented a date range selector to filter the data.
- Added skeleton loading states for a better user experience.

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to access a dedicated analytics dashboard with visual metrics cards and navigation,
**so that** I can quickly view training session performance data and make informed decisions about content effectiveness.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: User authentication system (Stories 1.3), dynamic dashboard grid (Stories 2.1, 6.1), session management (Epic 2), registration system (Epic 5)
- Technology: React frontend with TypeScript/Vite, Express backend with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- Follows pattern: Dashboard grid layout, authenticated page routing, existing component library (Shadcn/ui), Tailwind CSS styling
- Touch points: Content Developer role permissions, dashboard navigation, data visualization components, responsive design patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

**Navigation and Access Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can access analytics dashboard through main navigation menu with "Analytics" link
2. Analytics page is protected by authentication and requires Content Developer role permissions
3. Analytics dashboard follows existing page layout patterns with header, sidebar, and main content area
4. Analytics navigation is clearly highlighted when active, following existing UI patterns
5. Analytics page loads within 2 seconds with proper loading states during data fetch

**Dashboard Shell Requirements:**

6. Analytics dashboard displays overview metrics in grid card layout following existing dynamic grid patterns
7. Dashboard shows key performance indicator (KPI) cards for: Total Sessions, Total Registrations, Average Attendance Rate, Active Trainers
8. Each KPI card displays current value, percentage change from previous period, and visual trend indicator
9. KPI cards use consistent styling with existing dashboard cards (Shadcn/ui components)
10. Dashboard includes date range selector (Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last 90 days, Custom range)

**UI Component Requirements:**

11. Analytics dashboard uses established component hierarchy from existing pages (Layout, Header, Sidebar, Content)
12. Dashboard implements responsive design following Tailwind CSS mobile-first approach used throughout application
13. All interactive elements (date selectors, cards) provide proper hover/focus states using existing design tokens
14. Dashboard includes empty state messaging when no data is available for selected time period
15. Error states are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages and retry options

**Performance and UX Requirements:**

16. Dashboard skeleton loading states maintain layout consistency during data fetch operations
17. KPI cards are individually lazy-loaded to prevent blocking the entire dashboard
18. Dashboard maintains existing accessibility standards (WCAG AA compliance) with proper ARIA labels
19. Analytics dashboard works seamlessly on mobile devices with appropriate touch targets and readable text
20. Dashboard integrates with existing React Query caching patterns for optimal performance

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Dashboard patterns established in Stories 2.1 (Session Worksheet), 6.1 (Incentive Worksheet) provide grid layout foundation
- Authentication middleware from Story 1.3 handles role-based access control
- Component library patterns from recent stories use Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS consistently

**Data Models:**
- Read-only access to existing tables: `sessions`, `registrations`, `trainers`, `users` [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]
- No new database schema required - analytics queries against existing data
- Session status values: draft, published, expired [Source: previous stories]
- Registration sync_status tracking for data completeness [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md]

**API Specifications:**
- New analytics endpoints under `/admin/analytics/` following existing admin endpoint patterns [Source: architecture/4-api-specification-high-level.md]
- GET `/admin/analytics/overview` - Returns KPI summary data for dashboard cards
- GET `/admin/analytics/sessions` - Returns session performance metrics with date filtering
- JWT authentication required with Content Developer role validation [Source: architecture/4-api-specification-high-level.md]

**Component Specifications:**
- Use existing dashboard grid layout from `src/components/layout/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Leverage Shadcn/ui components: Card, Select, Button, Skeleton [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Implement React Query for data fetching following existing patterns [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**File Locations:**
- Main component: `src/pages/Analytics.tsx` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Subcomponents: `src/components/features/analytics/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- API routes: `src/server/routes/analytics.ts` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Type definitions: `src/types/analytics.ts` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for React components using React Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Integration tests for API endpoints using Supertest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Component tests for accessibility compliance [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Performance testing for dashboard load times [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must maintain performance of existing session/registration operations [Epic requirement]
- Read-only database queries only - no modifications to existing data
- TypeScript strict mode compliance [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS mobile-first approach [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
