# Story 1.4: Location Management

## Status
Done ✅

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to manage training locations through a comprehensive admin interface,
**so that** I can create, update, and organize venues for training sessions with proper capacity and address information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend CRUD API endpoints for location management at `/admin/locations`
2. Role-based access control restricting write operations to Content Developers
3. Location listing with pagination, search, and filtering capabilities
4. Create and edit location forms with validation (name, address, capacity)
5. Soft delete functionality (isActive flag) to preserve session history
6. Frontend admin interface integrated with existing dashboard navigation
7. Location capacity validation and management
8. Read access for all authenticated users (trainers need to see locations)
9. Integration with existing authentication and authorization system
10. Error handling and user feedback for all operations

## Dev Notes

### Location Management Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#4-api-specification, prd.md#fr1, #nfr7]

**Admin Endpoints Required:**
- `GET /admin/locations` - List locations with pagination/search
- `POST /admin/locations` - Create new location (Content Developer only)
- `GET /admin/locations/:id` - Get single location details
- `PUT /admin/locations/:id` - Update location (Content Developer only)
- `DELETE /admin/locations/:id` - Soft delete location (Content Developer only)

**Role-Based Access:**
- **Content Developer**: Full CRUD access to all location operations
- **Trainer**: Read-only access to view locations for session assignments
- **Broker**: Read-only access to view published session locations

**Location Data Management:**
- Name (required, max 255 characters)
- Address (optional, max 1000 characters)
- Capacity (optional, integer, minimum 1)
- Active status (boolean, default true)
- Created/updated timestamps
- Relationship to sessions for history preservation

### Database Integration Context
[Source: Story 1.2 completion, location entity implementation]

**Available Location Entity:**
- Complete TypeORM entity with validation decorators
- Proper relationships to Session entity established
- Database schema supports all required fields
- Entity includes isActive flag for soft deletion
- Created/updated timestamps for audit trail

**Integration Requirements:**
- Location entity already integrated with Session entity
- Foreign key relationship established (session.locationId)
- Database supports location capacity constraints
- Existing validation decorators ensure data integrity

### Frontend Integration Requirements
[Source: Story 1.3 frontend setup, authentication context]

**Existing Frontend Structure:**
- React Router setup with role-based protection
- Authentication context with role checking
- Dashboard page with admin navigation structure
- Protected route components for role-based access
- Shared TypeScript types for Location interface

**Location Management UI Requirements:**
- Admin interface accessible from Content Developer dashboard
- Location listing with search, filter, and pagination
- Create/edit forms with proper validation
- Confirmation dialogs for delete operations
- Integration with existing UI theme and components

### Technology Stack Integration
[Source: Story 1.1-1.3 dependencies, NestJS/React setup]

**Backend Dependencies Available:**
- NestJS module structure supports admin modules
- TypeORM entity ready for service integration
- Validation pipes and decorators established
- Role-based guards from authentication story
- Error handling patterns from existing modules

**Frontend Dependencies Available:**
- React Router for admin route management
- Authentication context for role checking
- API service patterns from auth implementation
- Form validation libraries and UI components
- State management for location data

### Testing Standards
**Location Management Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for location service CRUD operations
- Integration tests for API endpoints with role checking
- Frontend component testing for all user interactions
- Role-based access control validation
- Location capacity validation testing
- Search and filtering functionality testing

**Integration Testing:**
- Location creation with session assignment
- Role permission boundary testing
- Database constraint validation
- API error handling verification

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 1.1-1.3 completion]

**Completed Infrastructure:**
- Complete database schema with location table
- TypeORM entities with proper relationships
- Backend NestJS application with admin module patterns
- Frontend React application with role-based routing
- Authentication system with Content Developer permissions

**Integration Points:**
