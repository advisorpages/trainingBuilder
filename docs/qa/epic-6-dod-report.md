   - WebhookSyncService timeout issues
   - Worker process teardown problems

2. **Missing Story 6.5**
   - Clone Incentive functionality referenced in test plan
   - No implementation found in stories directory

3. **ESLint Configuration**
   - Missing across all packages
   - Cannot verify code quality standards

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority (Should Fix)

4. **Documentation Gap**
   - Zero technical documentation for incentive system
   - No user-facing documentation updates
   - Missing API documentation

5. **Manual Testing Evidence**
   - No developer verification notes
   - No evidence of actual user workflow testing

6. **Story Completion Tracking**
   - Missing wrap-up sections for 3/4 stories
   - Incomplete Dev Agent Records

### üí° Low Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Security Review**
   - Input validation verification needed

   - Inline documentation for complex logic

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Test Suite**
   ```bash
   # Investigate WebhookSyncService timeout issues
   # Add proper test teardown
   # Increase timeout for integration tests
   ```

2. **Implement Story 6.5**
   ```bash
   # Create clone incentive functionality
   # Update test plan alignment
   # Complete epic story set
   ```

3. **Configure ESLint**
   ```bash
   # Run: npm init @eslint/config
   # Apply to all packages
   # Fix any linting errors
   ```

### Before Production Release

4. **Create Documentation**
   - API documentation for incentive endpoints
   - User guide for incentive workflow
   - Technical architecture documentation

5. **Manual Testing**
   - Complete end-to-end user workflow testing
   - Document verification results in stories

6. **Complete Story Administration**
   - Finish wrap-up sections for all stories
   - Complete Dev Agent Records

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All tests passing (103/103)
- [ ] ESLint configuration active and passing
- [ ] Story 6.5 implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation created and reviewed
- [ ] Manual testing completed and documented
