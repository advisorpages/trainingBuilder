# Archived Backend Modules

These modules were moved during Phase 1 (Foundation Reset) to reduce scope creep. They remain here for reference and history.

| Module | Reason for Archival |
| --- | --- |
| admin | Consolidated into future builder-centric admin surfaces. |
| attributes | Attribute management folded into streamlined session metadata. |
| audiences | Deferred until demand for audience segmentation returns. |
| categories | Categories merged with the topics taxonomy. |
| dev | Developer experiments moved to docs/scripts. |
| locations | Session metadata now captures location details directly. |
| settings | Global settings to be redesigned later. |
| tones | Tone control absorbed by AI prompt presets. |
| trainer-dashboard | Old dashboard replaced by rebuild in later phases. |
