# Phase 3 Builder Session Notes – 2025-09-24

## Context
- User request: begin Phase 3 frontend builder implementation after completing Phases 1 & 2.
- Scope: rebuild `/sessions/builder/:sessionId` with autosave, AI integration, dual-pane UI, and shared component primitives.

## Key Changes Implemented
1. **Routing & Layout**
   - Added redirect `/sessions/builder -> /sessions/builder/new` and parameterized route (`packages/frontend/src/App.tsx`).
   - Introduced `BuilderLayout` with sidebar navigation and header status slot (`packages/frontend/src/layouts/BuilderLayout.tsx`).

2. **UI Component Kit**
   - New primitives under `packages/frontend/src/ui`: `button`, `input`, `card`, `tabs`, `progress`, `toast`, with index export for reuse.

3. **State Management**
   - Created builder reducer + context (`packages/frontend/src/features/session-builder/state/`).
   - State tracks metadata, outline, AI versions, autosave state, readiness score, and supports undo via snapshot restore.
   - Added Vitest coverage for reducer flows (`state/__tests__/builderReducer.test.ts`).

4. **Session Builder Page**
   - Replaced legacy wizard with dual-pane workspace:
     - Metadata form (`SessionMetadataForm.tsx`)
     - AI composer + version history (`AIComposer.tsx`)
     - Preview + readiness meter + quick-add modal (`ArtifactsPreview.tsx`, `QuickAddModal.tsx`)
     - Autosave indicator (`AutosaveIndicator.tsx`)
   - Autosave debounce posts to `/sessions/builder/:sessionId/autosave` and falls back to localStorage with undo toast.

5. **Documentation**
   - Authored `docs/frontend-builder.md` outlining architecture, flow, and next steps.
   - Logged backend autosave endpoint dependency in `docs/phase-issues.md` (Phase 3 entry).

## Tests & Results
- `npm run test --workspace=packages/frontend -- --run`
  - **Passed:** new reducer tests.
  - **Failed (pre-existing suites):**
    - `src/components/features/analytics/__tests__/KPIKard.test.tsx` – assertions expect literal glyphs/percent strings not produced.
    - `src/components/sessions/__tests__/SessionForm.test.tsx` – relies on real network (Axios to `/admin/*`) and expects topic labels.
    - Integration suites (`AuthFlow`, `SessionWorkflow`) break due to legacy `jest` mocks and hoisted vi.mock usage.
  - Note: no new builder-specific failures.

## Outstanding Items / Next Steps
1. **Backend Autosave Endpoint**
   - Implement `/sessions/builder/:id/autosave` returning `{ savedAt }` to replace local fallback (tracked in Phase Issues).

2. **Legacy Test Suites**
   - Decide whether to update, skip, or quarantine failing analytics/session suites until those areas are refactored.
   - Consider converting lingering `jest` mocks to `vi.mock` patterns to stop hoist errors.

3. **Builder Enhancements (Future Phases)**
   - Hook Quick Add sections into richer editors (Phase 4).
   - Hydrate trainer kit tab once backend assets available (Phase 4/5).
   - Extend toast provider globally if other modules need shared notifications.

## Continuation Notes – 2025-09-25
- Builder shell now lives under `packages/frontend/src/layouts/BuilderLayout.tsx` with sidebar nav and header status slot; any content page should render inside `BuilderLayout` to inherit autosave messaging and navigation.
- `SessionBuilderProvider` (see `packages/frontend/src/features/session-builder/state/SessionBuilderContext.tsx`) boots drafts from localStorage first, then `/sessions/builder/:id/complete-data`; autosave debounce funnels through `sessionBuilderService.autosaveDraft` and surfaces undo toasts.
- AI generation currently points to `/sessions/builder/suggest-outline`; failures fall back to a local `buildMockVersion` helper so we can unblock UI testing before backend integration stabilises.

### Gaps to Address Next
- Implement the real autosave endpoint and ensure it returns `{ savedAt }`; until then, saves land in localStorage and the toast mentions offline fallback.
- Wire the AI outline endpoint (or stub) so `generateSessionOutline` returns structured sections—remove the mock once backend responds consistently.
- Fill the placeholders in `sessionBuilderService.transformOutlineToSession` (`findCategoryIdByName`, topic mapping) so `createSessionFromOutline` can POST valid payloads.
- Flesh out reducer/Context coverage beyond the existing reducer unit test—add integration-style tests for autosave + undo behaviours.
- Audit `sessionBuilderService` for future-phase endpoints (templates, training/marketing kits) and either stub backend handlers or guard the calls so they do not break the current phase.

### Validation When Picking Back Up
- `npm run test --workspace=packages/frontend -- --run`
- Manual smoke: load `/sessions/builder/new`, edit metadata, confirm autosave toast + undo, trigger AI generation, accept a version, and reload to confirm local draft hydration.

## Working Plan – 2025-09-26
- Prioritise backend handshake for `/sessions/builder/:id/autosave`: scaffold NestJS handler + DTO returning `{ savedAt }`, wire service to persist JSONB draft, and swap frontend fallback messaging once tested.
- Align AI outline contract: confirm backend returns `SessionOutline` shape used in `SessionBuilderContext` (sections array, metadata). Until then, keep mock but gate behind feature flag to simplify removal.
- Implement category + topic resolution inside `sessionBuilderService.transformOutlineToSession`; pull IDs via cached lookups or extend backend response so we avoid client-side guessing.
- Expand Vitest coverage to exercise `SessionBuilderProvider` autosave debounce and undo path (simulate timers via `vi.useFakeTimers()`), plus acceptance flow updates readiness.
- Draft short runbook in `docs/frontend-builder.md` covering how to seed localStorage drafts for demos and how to clear them when QAing.
- Validate end-to-end by starting frontend (`npm run dev --workspace=packages/frontend`), editing builder fields, confirming API hits (once backend ready), and reloading to ensure persisted state.

## Update – 2025-09-26
- Added `SessionBuilderDraft` entity + migration to persist autosave payloads; service now upserts JSONB snapshots keyed by the builder session id and echoes the canonical `savedAt` timestamp (ISO string).
- `POST /sessions/builder/:id/autosave` wired through `SessionsController`/`SessionsService`; returns `{ savedAt }` so the frontend stops flagging the offline fallback path.
- `GET /sessions/builder/:id/complete-data` hydrates the builder with session metadata and any stored draft snapshot (`builderDraft`, `lastAutosaveAt`, `aiGeneratedContent`).
- Frontend toast copy now mentions server sync on success; still keeps localStorage fallback for offline undo.
- Phase issues log updated to mark the autosave dependency resolved.
- Added `POST /sessions/builder/suggest-outline` stub that returns the `SessionOutline` shape expected by the frontend; reducer tests now cover the autosave debounce + undo path via `SessionBuilderProvider`.
- `sessionBuilderService.createSessionFromOutline` now resolves topic IDs via `/topics`, removing the placeholder helper.
- `docs/frontend-builder.md` includes a short guide for seeding/clearing local drafts when demoing the feature.
