# Session & Incentive TypeScript Cleanup Follow-Ups

## Outstanding Test Failures
- Update `packages/frontend/src/services/__tests__/auth.service.test.ts` to expect the normalized `role` object (`{ id, key, name }`) instead of legacy string enums. Make similar adjustments wherever `mockUser.role` is still a string, including `src/__tests__/integration/AuthFlow.test.ts` and `src/contexts/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx`.
- Integration specs (`AuthFlow`, `SessionWorkflow`) need end-to-end mocks that align with the refactored services. `SessionForm` no longer calls `sessionService.getTopics` etc.â€”mock `trainerService`, `locationService`, `attributesService`, and `topicService` to prevent axios requests hitting jsdom.
- `SessionForm` component tests depend on specific label text ("Topic", "Save Draft"), but the new builder UI renders enhanced topic selectors without those labels. Either expose accessible labels in the component or relax the tests to target the new elements.
- `SessionMetadataForm` assertions use `getByDisplayValue('workshop')`, yet the select renders "Workshop" (capitalized). Switch the tests to use case-insensitive regex or `getByRole('combobox', { name: /session type/i })` and inspect `value` via assertions.
- `QuickAddModal` tests should query the descriptive paragraph with a regex or `getByText` that ignores whitespace, and use `getAllByRole` to disambiguate multiple buttons named "Exercise".
- `src/components/topics/__tests__/aiTopicEnhancement.test.ts` still imports `jest` globals. Convert the mocks to Vitest (`vi.mock`, `vi.fn`) and ensure the shared types import remains valid.

## Additional Cleanup Tasks
- Create reusable fixtures for the richer auth `User` shape so tests don't duplicate role metadata.
- Consider export helpers in the services folder to centralize axios mocking (reduces repeated boilerplate across tests).
- Audit other Jest-based specs under `packages/frontend/src/components/**/__tests__` and convert them to Vitest to avoid mixed runner issues.
- Confirm `AuthContext` initializes with the new `AuthContextType` (token + role object) and adjust any consumers relying on the string role.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Patch unit tests (auth service + UI components) to align with the updated domain types and rerun `vitest run`.
2. Refactor integration tests to mock the new service modules, ensuring no live network calls occur under jsdom.
3. Migrate the remaining Jest utilities/tests to Vitest so the workspace can rely on a single test runner.
