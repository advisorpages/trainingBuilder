## 🚨 Critical Blockers for Production

### **Code Quality Issues** ❌ **BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT**
- **18+ TypeScript compilation errors** in backend (auth service, user entity exports, test files)
- **15+ ESLint violations** across packages (unused imports, variables)
- **Test reliability issues** (console errors in passing tests)
- **Import/export path mismatches** affecting module resolution

### **Security & Infrastructure** ⚠️ **NEEDS ATTENTION**
- **Hardcoded API keys** still present in codebase
- **Production monitoring** needs alerting configuration
- **Secrets management** implementation required

### **Quality Assurance** ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT**
- **QR code service** missing API key configuration
- **Webhook sync** error handling needs improvement
- **Test console errors** need cleanup
