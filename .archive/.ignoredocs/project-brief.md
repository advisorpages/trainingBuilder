# Project Brief: Leadership Training App

## Executive Summary
The core concept is to build an application that streamlines the process of creating high-quality event and training "sessions" to increase team attendance. The app will address the problem of low attendance by reducing the time spent on planning and generating professional, high-value promotional content that clearly communicates the event's purpose and benefits. The primary target audience for this application is the leadership team and content creators who want to grow attendance among their teammates.

## Problem Statement
A significant amount of time is currently spent on planning training sessions, leaving too little time for effective invitations and promotion. This results in low attendance because the invitations lack clear promotional value, failing to excite prospective attendees about the event's content and benefits. Existing processes do not provide the tools needed to quickly generate compelling, high-quality promotional materials that justify an invitation and drive excitement.

## Proposed Solution
The application will provide an intuitive, mobile-first platform that empowers the leadership team and content creators to generate high-quality training and event sessions in minutes. It will solve the content-creation problem by leveraging a wizard-style interface that guides users through a structured process, culminating in AI-generated, professional sales copy for promotion. This copy will be crafted to create excitement and clearly communicate the value of attending, directly addressing the issue of low attendance. The app will also include features that allow for the easy reuse of past training content, eliminating the need to "reinvent the wheel" for every session. The interface will be optimized for use on a phone, with a secondary view for desktop users.

## Target Users
The primary user segment is the **Leadership Team** and **Content Creators** within the organization. They are responsible for developing and promoting training sessions but struggle with creating compelling content and generating excitement among their teammates. Their key pain points include:
* The time-consuming nature of planning and organizing new sessions.
* A lack of expertise in creating effective sales copy and promotional materials.
* The inefficiency of having to create new content from scratch for every event.

The secondary user segment is **Team Members** who are invited to the sessions. While they will not be creating content, their interaction with the app will be through the promotional materials and landing pages generated by the primary users.

## Goals & Success Metrics
This section establishes clear objectives for the project and how to measure its success.
