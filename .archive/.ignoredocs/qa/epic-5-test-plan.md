## CRITICAL BUGS FOUND - RESOLVED ✅

### Bug #1: Public Endpoints Authentication Issue - ✅ FIXED
**Priority:** CRITICAL - BLOCKS EPIC 5 FUNCTIONALITY (RESOLVED)
**Description:** The @Public() decorator was not functioning correctly for public endpoints due to NestJS route ordering issue
**Root Cause:** NestJS processes routes in definition order. The parameterized route `@Get(':id')` was defined before the specific public routes `@Get('public')`, causing `/api/sessions/public` to match the `:id` parameter route instead.
**Fix Applied:** Moved all public routes before the parameterized `@Get(':id')` route in sessions.controller.ts
**Evidence (BEFORE FIX):**
- Backend logs show `isPublic: undefined` for `/api/sessions/public` route
- Public endpoints return 401 Unauthorized instead of allowing public access
- JWT Guard logs: `JWT Guard - Route: GET /api/sessions/public, isPublic: undefined`
**Expected:** Public endpoints should bypass authentication
**Actual:** Public endpoints require authentication tokens
**Impact:** Completely blocks public access to sessions, registration, and QR code functionality
**Files affected:**
- `/packages/backend/src/modules/sessions/sessions.controller.ts` (lines 261-264)
- `/packages/backend/src/common/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`
- `/packages/backend/src/common/decorators/public.decorator.ts`

**Verification (AFTER FIX):**
- ✅ `GET /api/sessions/public` returns 200 with session data
- ✅ `GET /api/sessions/public/:id` returns 200 with specific session details
- ✅ `POST /api/sessions/:id/register` returns 200 with successful registration
- ✅ All public endpoints now bypass authentication correctly
- ✅ JWT Guard no longer blocks public routes

**Test Results:**
```bash
# Public sessions endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/sessions/public
# Returns: Array of 3 published sessions with complete location/trainer details

# Public session detail endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/sessions/public/9541705b-342f-469f-ba8b-5be71cb25d55
# Returns: Complete session details with location and trainer information

# Public registration endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/sessions/9541705b-342f-469f-ba8b-5be71cb25d55/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@test.com"}'
# Returns: {"success":true,"message":"Registration successful!","registrationId":"9c0d30d2-92f9-470c-8ee1-1373f98c781a"}
```

**Status:** RESOLVED - Epic 5 public functionality now fully operational
