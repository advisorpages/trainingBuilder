# Story 3.2: Manual Status Updates

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to manually change the status of my sessions,
**so that** I can control when sessions become published and manage their lifecycle.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Session status display (Story 3.1), session management (Epic 2), content finalization (Story 2.6)
- Technology: React frontend with status update controls, NestJS backend with status transition logic
- Follows pattern: Form submission and state management patterns from existing admin interfaces
- Touch points: Session detail views, status management interface, publishing workflow, content validation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can change session status through intuitive interface controls
2. System validates status transitions and prevents invalid changes
3. Content Developer receives confirmation before making status changes
4. System records status change history with timestamps and user information
5. Content Developer can add notes or reasons for status changes
6. Status changes trigger appropriate notifications and updates

**Validation Requirements:**

7. System enforces business rules for status transitions (draft→published, published→completed, etc.)
8. Content validation occurs before allowing publication (required fields, content completeness)
9. System prevents status changes that would violate business logic or data integrity

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Status update interface is intuitive and follows consistent design patterns
11. Status changes are immediate and provide clear feedback to the user
12. Error handling provides helpful guidance when status changes fail

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add status update controls to session management interfaces with backend validation
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow form submission and validation patterns from session editing
- **Key Constraints:** Must enforce business rules while providing flexible status management

## Dev Notes

### Status Transition Business Rules
[Source: Epic 3 publishing workflow and session lifecycle management]

**Valid Transitions:**
- Draft → Published (with content validation)
- Draft → Cancelled (with confirmation)
- Published → Completed (manual or automatic after end time)
- Published → Cancelled (with confirmation and impact warning)

**Invalid Transitions:**
- Completed → Published (sessions cannot be republished after completion)
- Cancelled → Published (cancelled sessions cannot be republished)
- Any backward transitions that would violate business logic

**Content Validation Requirements:**
- Session must have title and description
- Session must have start/end times and location
- Session should have promotional content (headlines, benefits, etc.)
- Session must have trainer assigned
- All required fields must be populated

### Status Update Interface Design
[Source: Existing admin interface patterns and user experience needs]

**Interface Components:**
- Status dropdown/selector in session details
- "Publish Session" prominent button for draft sessions
- Status change confirmation modals
- Status history panel with change log
- Content validation checklist before publishing

**User Experience Flow:**
1. Content Developer views session in draft status
2. Clicks "Publish Session" or status dropdown
3. System validates content completeness
4. If validation passes, shows publish confirmation
5. User confirms publication with optional notes
6. System updates status and shows success feedback

### Integration with Epic 2 Workflow
**Content Creation to Publishing Flow:**
1. Session created in worksheet (Story 2.1) → Draft status
2. Content generated and integrated (Stories 2.3-2.6) → Draft with content
3. Content Developer reviews and finalizes → Ready for publishing
4. Manual status update to Published → Live session
5. After session occurs → Manual or automatic completion

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can easily and safely manage session status transitions with proper validation, confirmation, and feedback throughout the publishing lifecycle.
