# Story 3.1: Display Session Status

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to see the current status of my sessions at a glance,
**so that** I can understand where each session is in the publishing lifecycle.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Session management (Epic 2), draft system (Story 2.2), content integration (Story 2.6)
- Technology: React frontend with status indicators, NestJS backend, session status enum updates
- Follows pattern: Dashboard display patterns and status management workflows
- Touch points: Session lists, session details, draft management, publishing preparation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can see session status in session lists (draft, published, completed, cancelled)
2. Session status is clearly displayed with visual indicators (colors, icons, badges)
3. Content Developer can see status history and transition timestamps
4. Status display includes helpful descriptions of what each status means
5. Content Developer can filter sessions by status
6. Status display shows next possible actions for each status

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Status display integrates with existing session lists and management interfaces
8. Status information is consistent across all views (lists, details, modals)
9. Integration maintains performance with large numbers of sessions

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Status information is accurate and updates in real-time
11. Visual design is clear and follows accessibility best practices
12. Status display is intuitive and doesn't overwhelm the interface

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing session list and detail components with status display
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow status indicator patterns from existing admin interfaces
- **Key Constraints:** Status must be clearly visible without cluttering the interface

## Dev Notes

### Session Status Lifecycle
[Source: Epic 3 publishing requirements and session management needs]

**Status Definitions:**
- **Draft:** Session is being created/edited, not visible to public
- **Published:** Session is live and available for registration
- **Completed:** Session has occurred and is finished
- **Cancelled:** Session was cancelled and is no longer available

**Status Transitions:**
- Draft → Published (manual or automated publishing)
- Published → Completed (after session end time)
- Published → Cancelled (manual cancellation)
- Draft → Cancelled (cancellation before publishing)

**Visual Indicators:**
- Draft: Blue color, draft icon, "In Progress" badge
- Published: Green color, published icon, "Live" badge
- Completed: Gray color, completed icon, "Finished" badge
- Cancelled: Red color, cancelled icon, "Cancelled" badge

### Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 2 content creation and existing session management]

**Component Integration:**
- Extend existing session list components with status columns
- Add status filters to session management interfaces
- Integrate with session detail modals and pages
- Maintain consistency with existing admin interface patterns

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient status queries with proper database indexing
- Cached status information for large session lists
- Real-time updates without full page refreshes
- Optimized rendering for status visual indicators

### User Experience Flow
**Status Visibility Workflow:**
1. Content Developer views session list with clear status indicators
2. Can filter sessions by status (all, draft, published, etc.)
3. Clicks on session to see detailed status information
4. Views status history and next possible actions
5. Understands workflow progress and next steps

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can immediately understand the status of any session and know what actions are available to them based on the current lifecycle state.
