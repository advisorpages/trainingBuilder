# Story 1.7: Attribute Management

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** admin interfaces to manage system attributes (topics, audiences, tones, categories),
**so that** I can customize the available options for content creation workflows.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Database schema from Story 1.2 (topics, audiences, tones, categories tables)
- Technology: React frontend with NestJS backend API
- Follows pattern: Existing admin interfaces from Stories 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
- Touch points: TypeORM entities, REST API endpoints, React admin components

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Content Developers can view, create, edit, and delete topics
2. Content Developers can view, create, edit, and delete audiences
3. Content Developers can view, create, edit, and delete tones
4. Content Developers can view, create, edit, and delete categories
5. Each attribute type has a dedicated admin page with CRUD operations
6. Validation prevents deletion of attributes that are in use by sessions/incentives

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Existing location, trainer, and system configuration management continues to work unchanged
8. New attribute management follows existing admin interface pattern from Stories 1.4-1.6
9. Integration with existing TypeORM entities maintains current database relationships

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Changes are covered by appropriate tests
11. Admin interface follows existing design patterns and styling
12. No regression in existing admin functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend existing admin interface structure with new attribute management pages
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow admin interface patterns from location-management and trainer-resource-management
- **Key Constraints:** Must preserve referential integrity when deleting attributes referenced by sessions

## Definition of Done

- [x] Functional requirements met (topics, audiences, tones, categories CRUD)
- [x] Integration requirements verified (existing admin interfaces work)
- [x] Existing functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Admin interface follows consistent design patterns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Deleting attributes that are referenced by existing sessions/incentives
- **Mitigation:** Add referential integrity checks before allowing deletions
- **Rollback:** Database constraints prevent data corruption; UI changes are additive only

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes are read/write operations on existing attribute tables only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing admin interface design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (simple CRUD operations)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Backend API Endpoints (AC: 1-4, 6)
  - [x] Create topics CRUD controller with validation
  - [x] Create audiences CRUD controller with validation
  - [x] Create tones CRUD controller with validation
  - [x] Create categories CRUD controller with validation
  - [x] Add referential integrity checks for delete operations
  - [x] Add proper error handling and validation messages

- [x] Task 2: Frontend Admin Components (AC: 1-5, 11)
  - [x] Create topics management page following existing admin pattern
  - [x] Create audiences management page following existing admin pattern
  - [x] Create tones management page following existing admin pattern
  - [x] Create categories management page following existing admin pattern
  - [x] Add navigation menu items for attribute management
  - [x] Implement consistent styling and user feedback patterns

- [x] Task 3: Integration & Testing (AC: 7-10, 12)
  - [x] Test existing admin interfaces continue working
  - [x] Add unit tests for new API endpoints
  - [x] Add integration tests for CRUD operations
  - [x] Test referential integrity constraints
  - [x] Verify consistent admin interface behavior
  - [x] Run full regression test suite

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Context
[Source: Stories 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6]

**Database Tables Available:**
- `topics` - Content topics with id, name, description, is_active
- `audiences` - Target audience types with id, name, description, is_active
- `tones` - AI generation tones with id, name, description, is_active
- `categories` - Content categories with id, name, description, is_active

**Existing Admin Interface Pattern:**
- React components in packages/frontend/src/pages/admin/
- NestJS controllers in packages/backend/src/controllers/
- Consistent CRUD operations with validation
- TypeORM entities with proper relationships
- Form validation and error handling patterns

**Referential Integrity Considerations:**
- Topics are referenced by sessions (session_topics join table)
- Audiences, tones, categories will be used by sessions and incentives
- Must prevent deletion of attributes that are in use
- Should provide clear error messages when deletion is blocked

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can manage all system attributes through intuitive admin interfaces that follow existing patterns, with proper validation to maintain data integrity.
