## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#3-database-schema]

**Complete Table Structure Required:**

**Core Tables:**
- `users` - User accounts with role relationships ✅ (partial - needs completion)
- `roles` - User roles (Broker, Content Developer, Trainer) ✅ (complete)
- `system_settings` - Configuration key-value store ✅ (complete)

**Resource Tables (Brownfield Integration):**
- `locations` - Event locations ✅ (basic structure exists)
- `trainers` - Trainer profiles ✅ (basic structure exists)
- `topics` - Content topics ✅ (basic structure exists)
- `audiences` - Target audience types ✅ (basic structure exists)
- `tones` - AI generation tones ✅ (basic structure exists)
- `categories` - Content categories ✅ (basic structure exists)

**New Feature Tables (To be implemented):**
- `sessions` - Core training sessions with full relationships
- `session_topics` - Many-to-many join table for sessions and topics
- `incentives` - Promotional incentives with lifecycle management
- `registrations` - Session registrations with sync status tracking
- `coaching_tips` - AI-generated reusable coaching content
- `topic_coaching_tips` - Many-to-many join table for tips and topics

**TypeORM Entity Configuration Requirements:**
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack, brownfield integration needs]

- UUID primary keys for user-facing entities (users, sessions, incentives)
- Serial integer keys for administrative/reference data
- Proper relationship decorators (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany)
- Validation decorators for email, required fields, length constraints
- Timestamps for audit trails (created_at, updated_at)
- Soft deletes for sessions and incentives (is_active flags)
- Indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields

**Role-Based Access Requirements:**
[Source: architecture.md#4-api-specification, prd.md#nfr7]

- Broker: Limited read access to published sessions
- Content Developer: Full CRUD on sessions, incentives, and admin resources
- Trainer: Read access to assigned sessions with detailed information

**Database Performance Considerations:**
- Indexes on user email for authentication lookups
- Indexes on session status and dates for dashboard queries
- Indexes on foreign key relationships
- Composite indexes for complex queries (e.g., trainer sessions by date range)

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 1.1 completion]

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- Docker Compose with PostgreSQL 15 container
- Basic schema initialization script created
- Database connection configuration in place
- TypeORM configuration partially set up in backend

**Integration Points:**
- Backend NestJS application ready for entity integration
- Environment variables configured for database connection
- Shared package contains TypeScript interfaces that should align with entities

### Testing Standards
**Database Testing Requirements:**
- Integration tests for entity relationships
- Migration testing (up and down)
- Performance testing with sample data sets
- Constraint validation testing
- Health check endpoint validation
- Cross-entity query testing for complex relationships

**No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs beyond basic validation**
