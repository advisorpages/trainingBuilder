# Story 2.6: Save AI Content to Draft

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to save my final AI-generated content selections to my session draft,
**so that** I can complete the content creation workflow and prepare for publishing.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Content regeneration (Story 2.5), session draft system (Story 2.2), content generation workflow
- Technology: React frontend, NestJS backend, PostgreSQL database with session entity updates
- Follows pattern: Draft saving patterns from Story 2.2 and content management workflows
- Touch points: Session entity updates, generated content storage, workflow completion, publishing preparation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can save selected AI-generated content to their session draft
2. System updates session entity with final promotional content in appropriate fields
3. Content Developer can preview final session with all content before saving
4. System preserves generation history and metadata for future reference
5. Saved content is properly formatted and ready for publishing workflow
6. Content Developer can return to regeneration if not satisfied before final save

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Content saving integrates seamlessly with regeneration workflow (Story 2.5) and draft system (Story 2.2)
8. Saved content follows database schema requirements for session promotional content
9. Integration maintains all session relationships and data integrity

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Content saving is reliable with proper error handling and user feedback
11. Final content preview accurately represents what will be published
12. Workflow completion provides clear next steps toward publishing

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend session draft system to store AI-generated promotional content
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow draft saving patterns from Story 2.2 with content-specific enhancements
- **Key Constraints:** Must properly structure content for database storage and future publishing workflow

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Updates
[Source: Story 1.2 session entity and Epic 2 content requirements]

**Session Entity Content Fields:**
- `promotional_headline` - Primary headline for session promotion
- `promotional_description` - Detailed session description for listings
- `social_media_copy` - Social media formatted promotional content
- `email_copy` - Email marketing content for announcements
- `key_benefits` - Structured list of session value propositions
- `call_to_action` - Compelling registration prompts

**Content Metadata Fields:**
- `content_generation_date` - Timestamp of last content generation
- `content_prompt_version` - Reference to prompt used for generation
- `content_generation_iterations` - Number of regeneration cycles performed
- `content_generation_metadata` - JSON field for additional generation data

### Content Storage Strategy
[Source: Stories 2.4, 2.5 content generation and versioning]

**Content Format Requirements:**
- Structured JSON for complex content types (key benefits, multiple headlines)
- Plain text for simple content (descriptions, calls to action)
- Formatted HTML for rich content where needed
- Metadata preservation for content provenance and audit trails

**Version History Management:**
- Preserve final selected content in session entity
- Archive generation history in separate content_generation_history table
- Enable future content regeneration from stored prompts and parameters
- Maintain audit trail for content changes and approval workflow

### Workflow Integration
[Source: Epic 2 complete workflow and Epic 3 publishing preparation]

**Workflow State Management:**
- Update session status from 'draft' to 'content-complete' after saving
- Prepare session for publishing workflow transition (Epic 3)
- Maintain workflow context for future content modifications
- Enable workflow resumption if content changes are needed

**Publishing Preparation:**
- Ensure content format compatibility with publishing workflow
- Validate content completeness for publishing requirements
- Prepare metadata needed for public-facing session display
- Set up content approval workflow for Epic 3 integration

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can save their finalized AI-generated content to their session draft, completing the content creation workflow with properly formatted and stored promotional materials ready for the publishing phase.
