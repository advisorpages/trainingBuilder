# Story 1.1: Project & Docker Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a fully configured monorepo development environment with Docker Compose setup,
**so that** I can efficiently develop the Leadership Training App with consistent local and production-like environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure is created with packages for frontend, backend, and shared modules
2. Docker Compose configuration provides containerized development environment
3. PostgreSQL database container is configured and accessible
4. Frontend React+TypeScript application is set up and runs in container
5. Backend NestJS+TypeScript API server is set up and runs in container
6. Shared package provides common types and constants
7. All containers can communicate and the application stack starts successfully
8. Development environment supports hot-reloading for both frontend and backend

- [ ] Task 5: Configure Shared Package (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration for shared types
  - [ ] Create basic interfaces and constants
  - [ ] Configure build process for shared package
  - [ ] Link shared package to frontend and backend

- [ ] Task 6: Integration Testing (AC: 7, 8)
  - [ ] Test full stack startup with docker-compose up
  - [ ] Verify database connectivity from backend
  - [ ] Verify frontend can communicate with backend
  - [ ] Test hot-reloading functionality

## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md#1-high-level-architecture, #2-project-structure]

**Project Structure Requirements:**
- Monorepo organization using packages directory
- React+TypeScript SPA for frontend
- NestJS+TypeScript API server for backend
- PostgreSQL database (brownfield integration)
- Docker Compose for development environment
- Shared TypeScript library for consistency

**Directory Structure to Implement:**
```
/ (root)
|-- docker-compose.yml
|-- package.json
|-- packages/
|   |-- frontend/ (React+TypeScript SPA)
|   |   |-- public/
|   |   |-- src/
|   |   |   |-- components/
|   |   |   |-- pages/
|   |   |   |-- services/
|   |   |-- Dockerfile
|   |   |-- package.json
|   |-- backend/ (NestJS+TypeScript API)
|   |   |-- src/
|   |   |   |-- modules/
|   |   |   |   |-- auth/
|   |   |   |   |-- sessions/
|   |   |   |   |-- users/
|   |   |   |-- services/
|   |   |   |   |-- ai.service.ts
|   |   |-- Dockerfile
|   |   |-- package.json
|   |-- shared/ (Common types/constants)
|   |   |-- src/
|   |   |   |-- types/
|   |   |   |-- constants.ts
|   |   |-- package.json
```

**Database Requirements:**
[Source: architecture.md#3-database-schema]
- PostgreSQL database with brownfield integration
- Must support existing tables: locations, trainers, topics
- New tables for: users, roles, sessions, incentives, registrations

**API Architecture:**
[Source: architecture.md#4-api-specification]
- RESTful API with JWT authentication
- Role-based permissions (Broker, Content Developer, Trainer)
- Public endpoints for sessions and registration
- Admin endpoints for content management
- Trainer endpoints for dashboard access

### Testing Standards
**Testing Requirements:**
- No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs
- Implement basic health checks for services
- Include integration tests for Docker stack startup
- Test hot-reloading functionality
- Document development workflow and troubleshooting

**Previous Story Insights:**
- This is the first story in Epic 1, no previous story context available
