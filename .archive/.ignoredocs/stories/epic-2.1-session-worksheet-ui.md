# Epic 2.1: Session Worksheet UI - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create a comprehensive session worksheet UI that enables Content Developers to input all necessary training session details through an intuitive, form-based interface that integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication and resource management systems.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Authentication system for all user roles (Brokers, Content Developers, Trainers) and basic resource management for trainers and locations from Epic 1
- Technology stack: React (Vite) + TypeScript frontend, Node.js (NestJS) + TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL database
- Integration points: User authentication, trainer management, location management, and system configuration/attribute data

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Building the primary content creation interface that allows Content Developers to create training session drafts through a structured form
- How it integrates: Leverages existing authentication to secure access, pulls trainer and location data from Epic 1 systems, and creates session records in the established database schema
- Success criteria: Content Developers can successfully create and view session worksheets with all required fields, proper validation, and seamless integration with existing data

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1.1:** Session Worksheet Form Structure - Create the basic form layout with all required fields for session creation
2. **Story 2.1.2:** Data Integration - Connect form to existing trainer and location APIs from Epic 1 for dropdown/selection functionality
3. **Story 2.1.3:** Form Validation & Persistence - Implement client-side validation and save draft functionality to database

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged - leverages Epic 1 trainer/location endpoints
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible - extends session table structure
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns - uses established React component patterns
- [x] Performance impact is minimal - form-based interface with standard data loading

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Form complexity could overwhelm users or break existing Epic 1 integration points
- **Mitigation:** Progressive form design with clear sections, thorough testing of Epic 1 API integration
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flagging allows instant disable, database migrations are reversible

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing Epic 1 functionality verified through testing (auth, trainer/location management)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly with no performance degradation
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately for new endpoints and UI components
- [ ] No regression in existing features - comprehensive integration testing completed

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural documentation is required - follows existing patterns
- [x] Enhancement follows existing React/NestJS patterns
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable - leverages established Epic 1 APIs

**Risk Assessment:**
- [x] Risk to existing system is low - additive feature with no Epic 1 modifications
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible - feature flags and reversible database changes
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality - integration test suite expanded
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points - Epic 1 APIs well documented

**Completeness Check:**
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable - focused UI development with clear boundaries
- [x] Stories are properly scoped - form creation, integration, validation/persistence
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - functional form with working Epic 1 integration
- [x] Dependencies are identified - Epic 1 completion required

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running React (Vite) + TypeScript frontend, Node.js (NestJS) + TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL database
- Integration points: User authentication system, trainer management APIs, location management APIs, system configuration/attributes from Epic 1
- Existing patterns to follow: Established React component patterns, NestJS service patterns, existing form validation approaches
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must not modify Epic 1 APIs, must maintain existing authentication flow, database changes must be backward compatible
- Each story must include verification that existing Epic 1 functionality (auth, trainer management, location management) remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a comprehensive session worksheet UI that enables Content Developers to create training sessions."
