# Story 2.4: AI Copy Generation and Display

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** the system to generate promotional copy using the reviewed AI prompt and display the results,
**so that** I can see the AI-generated content for my training session.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: AI prompt generation (Story 2.3), session workflow from Stories 2.1-2.2
- Technology: React frontend, NestJS backend, AI service (OpenAI/LLM), content display components
- Follows pattern: API integration and content display patterns from existing system
- Touch points: AI service, generated content storage, content preview interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. System generates promotional copy using the approved AI prompt from Story 2.3
2. Generated content includes multiple content types (headlines, descriptions, social media posts)
3. Content Developer can view all generated content in organized, readable format
4. Generated content is displayed with clear labeling and formatting
5. System provides content generation progress indicators during AI processing
6. Generated content includes metadata (generation timestamp, prompt used, content types)

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Content generation seamlessly follows prompt review workflow (Story 2.3)
8. Generated content follows consistent formatting and branding guidelines
9. Integration maintains session context and generated content relationships

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Content generation provides clear loading states and error handling
11. Generated content is properly formatted and visually appealing
12. Interface follows existing admin design patterns for content display

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend AI service from Story 2.3 to handle content generation and result processing
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow content display patterns from existing admin interfaces
- **Key Constraints:** AI service reliability critical; content quality and formatting important for user experience

## Dev Notes

### Content Generation Requirements
[Source: Epic 2 goals and training session promotional needs]

**Content Types to Generate:**
- **Headlines:** Multiple headline options for promotional materials
- **Descriptions:** Long-form session descriptions for detailed listings
- **Social Media Posts:** Twitter/LinkedIn formatted posts for promotion
- **Email Copy:** Email marketing content for session announcements
- **Key Benefits:** Bullet points highlighting session value propositions
- **Call-to-Action:** Compelling registration prompts

**Content Quality Standards:**
- Professional tone appropriate for business training
- Branded language consistent with organization style
- Accurate technical information based on session details
- Compelling and action-oriented promotional copy
- Appropriate length for each content type

### AI Service Integration
[Source: Story 2.3 AI prompt generation]

**Generation Process:**
- Use approved prompt from Story 2.3 as generation input
- Structured AI requests for each content type
- Parallel or sequential generation based on service limitations
- Content parsing and validation post-generation
- Storage of both raw AI output and formatted content

**Technical Considerations:**
- AI service rate limiting and cost management
- Generation timeout handling (some content may take longer)
- Content length validation and truncation if needed
- Consistent formatting across different content types

### User Experience Flow
**Complete Workflow Integration:**
1. Session worksheet creation (Story 2.1)
2. Draft saving (Story 2.2)
3. AI prompt generation and review (Story 2.3)
4. **AI content generation and display (this story)**
5. Content editing and regeneration (Story 2.5)
6. Final content saving (Story 2.6)

### Success Criteria
The story is successful when Content Developers can generate high-quality, professionally formatted promotional content from their AI prompts and view it in an organized, user-friendly interface.
