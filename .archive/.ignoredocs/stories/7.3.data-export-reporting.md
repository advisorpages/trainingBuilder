# Story 7.3: Data Export & Reporting

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Full export functionality with multiple formats implemented

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to export analytics data and generate customizable reports in multiple formats,
**so that** I can share training performance insights with leadership and stakeholders who need offline access to data.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Analytics dashboard UI (Story 7.1), session performance analytics (Story 7.2), authentication system (Story 1.3)
- Technology: React frontend with file download capabilities, Express backend with report generation libraries, PostgreSQL data aggregation
- Follows pattern: Existing API patterns, file handling patterns, authentication middleware, form validation patterns
- Touch points: Analytics data processing, file generation, secure download links, dashboard integration

## Acceptance Criteria

**Export Format Requirements:**

1. Content Developer can export analytics data in CSV format for spreadsheet analysis
2. PDF report generation with formatted charts, tables, and executive summary
3. Excel (XLSX) export with multiple worksheets for different data categories
4. JSON export for integration with external analytics tools
5. All export formats include metadata (generation date, filter criteria, data range)
6. Export files are named with timestamps and filter descriptions for easy identification

**Customizable Report Options:**

7. Content Developer can select specific data ranges for export (custom date ranges)
8. Report includes/excludes options for different metrics (sessions, registrations, trainers, topics)
9. Customizable report title and description fields for personalized reporting
10. Option to include/exclude charts and visualizations in PDF reports
11. Executive summary section with key insights and recommendations (auto-generated)
12. Ability to save report templates for recurring reporting needs

**Data Export Controls:**

13. Real-time export preview showing estimated file size and record count
14. Export progress indicator for large datasets with cancel option
15. Export history showing previous downloads with re-download capability
16. Batch export functionality for multiple report types simultaneously
17. Scheduled export option for regular reporting (weekly/monthly)
18. Export validation ensuring data integrity and completeness

**Security and Access Requirements:**

19. Export functionality restricted to Content Developer role with proper authentication
20. Generated files include watermark/header identifying the user and generation time
21. Export download links expire after 24 hours for security
22. Audit log tracking all export activities with user identification
23. File size limitations prevent system resource abuse (max 50MB per export)
24. Sensitive data anonymization options for external sharing

**Performance and User Experience:**

25. Small exports (< 1000 records) complete within 10 seconds
26. Large exports provide email notification when ready for download
27. Export interface is accessible from both main analytics dashboard and individual chart views
28. Clear error messages for failed exports with retry options
29. Export options are contextually available based on current filter selections
30. Mobile-responsive export interface for tablet users

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Stories 7.1 and 7.2 provide analytics data structure and filtering mechanisms
- Existing authentication from Story 1.3 provides role-based access control foundation
- Dashboard patterns established provide UI integration points for export controls

**Data Models:**
- Leverages existing analytics queries from Story 7.2 for data aggregation
- Export metadata table: `export_logs` for tracking and audit purposes
- Temporary file storage for large export processing
- User preferences for saved report templates [Source: architecture/3-database-schema.md pattern]

**API Specifications:**
- POST `/admin/analytics/export` - Initiate export with format and filter parameters [Source: architecture/4-api-specification-high-level.md]
- GET `/admin/analytics/export/{id}/download` - Secure download endpoint with expiring tokens
- GET `/admin/analytics/export/history` - Export history for re-downloads
- DELETE `/admin/analytics/export/{id}` - Clean up expired export files
- POST `/admin/analytics/export/schedule` - Schedule recurring exports

**Component Specifications:**
- Export modal component using Shadcn/ui Dialog [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Form components for export configuration using React Hook Form [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Progress indicator using Shadcn/ui Progress component
- File download handling with browser-native download functionality
- Report template management interface [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**File Locations:**
- Export components: `src/components/features/analytics/export/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Export service: `src/server/services/exportService.ts` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Report generators: `src/server/utils/reportGenerators/` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Export types: `src/types/export.ts` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Export API routes: `src/server/routes/export.ts` [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for export component interfaces and form validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Integration tests for file generation with various format options
- Performance tests for large dataset exports (10,000+ records) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Security tests for file access controls and token expiration
- File format validation tests ensuring proper CSV/PDF/Excel structure

**Technical Constraints:**
- Implement streaming for large CSV exports to prevent memory issues
- Use worker threads for PDF generation to avoid blocking main process
- Secure file storage with automatic cleanup of expired downloads
- File generation must not impact analytics dashboard performance [Epic requirement]
- TypeScript strict mode for all export-related code [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
