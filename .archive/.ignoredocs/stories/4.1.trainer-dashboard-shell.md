# Story 4.1: Trainer Dashboard Shell

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** Trainer,
**I want** a dedicated dashboard interface accessible only to trainers,
**so that** I can access my training assignments and materials in a secure, trainer-specific workspace.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Authentication system (Story 1.3), user role management, session management
- Technology: React frontend with TypeScript, NestJS backend API
- Follows pattern: Existing dashboard patterns from main dashboard but trainer-specific
- Touch points: User entity, Role entity, Session entity, trainer authentication

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Trainer can access dedicated dashboard from main navigation when logged in as Trainer role
2. Dashboard displays welcome message with trainer's information
3. Dashboard shows summary statistics (upcoming sessions count, total coaching tips)
4. Dashboard provides quick action buttons for common trainer tasks
5. Dashboard restricts access to non-trainer users with appropriate error messages
6. Dashboard integrates with existing authentication and logout functionality

**Integration Requirements:**

7. Existing authentication system controls access to trainer dashboard (Trainer role only)
8. Dashboard navigation integrates with existing app routing structure
9. Consistent styling with existing dashboard interfaces

**Quality Requirements:**

10. Dashboard follows existing design patterns and responsive layouts
11. Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
12. No regression in existing authentication or navigation functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create new trainer dashboard page within existing app structure
