## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
Epic 4 completed the trainer dashboard and coaching tip functionality. The system now has full content creation, publishing, and trainer management workflows in place.

**Data Models:**
- Sessions table with published status filtering [Source: architecture.md#database-schema]
- Frontend will consume GET /sessions public API endpoint [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]
- Session fields: id, title, description, start_time, end_time, status, location_id, trainer_id [Source: architecture.md#feature-tables]

**API Specifications:**
- GET /sessions: Public endpoint returning published sessions [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]
- Response includes session details with related location and trainer data
- No authentication required for public session listing

**Component Specifications:**
- React SPA architecture with TypeScript [Source: architecture.md#high-level-architecture]
- Component structure: packages/frontend/src/components/ and pages/ [Source: architecture.md#project-structure]
- Shared types from packages/shared/src/types/ for consistency [Source: architecture.md#project-structure]

**File Locations:**
- Homepage component: packages/frontend/src/pages/PublicHomepage.tsx
- Session card component: packages/frontend/src/components/SessionCard.tsx
- Public routing: packages/frontend/src/App.tsx or routing configuration
