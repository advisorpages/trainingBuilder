# Story 1.6: System Configuration Management

## Status
Done ✅

## Story
**As a** Content Developer,
**I want** to manage system-wide configuration settings through a comprehensive admin interface,
**so that** I can configure application behavior, default values, and operational parameters without code changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend CRUD API endpoints for system settings management at `/admin/settings`
2. Role-based access control restricting write operations to Content Developers
3. System settings listing with search and filtering capabilities
4. Create and edit system settings forms with validation (key, value, description)
5. Settings categorization and grouping for better organization
6. Frontend admin interface integrated with existing dashboard navigation
7. Settings management with data type validation (string, number, boolean, JSON)
8. Read access for system components to retrieve configuration values
9. Integration with existing authentication and authorization system
10. Error handling and user feedback for all operations

## Dev Notes

### System Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#3-database-schema, #4-api-specification]

**Admin Endpoints Required:**
- `GET /admin/settings` - List settings with search/filtering
- `POST /admin/settings` - Create new setting (Content Developer only)
- `GET /admin/settings/:key` - Get single setting details
- `PUT /admin/settings/:key` - Update setting (Content Developer only)
- `DELETE /admin/settings/:key` - Delete setting (Content Developer only)

**Role-Based Access:**
- **Content Developer**: Full CRUD access to all settings operations
- **System Components**: Read-only access to retrieve configuration values
- **Other Users**: No direct access to settings management

**System Settings Data Management:**
- Key (required, unique, string, used as primary key)
- Value (required, flexible data type: string, number, boolean, JSON)
- Description (optional, string, max 500 characters)
- Category (optional, string, for grouping and organization)
- Data type indicator (string, number, boolean, json)
- Created/updated timestamps
- Default value storage for reset functionality

### Database Integration Context
[Source: architecture.md#3-database-schema]

**System Settings Entity Definition:**
- Table: `system_settings` as defined in architecture
- Key-value store for admin-configurable settings
- Primary key: `key` (string)
- Value field supports various data types
- Must be created as new TypeORM entity following existing patterns
- Integration with existing authentication and role systems

**Integration Requirements:**
- New entity following established TypeORM patterns
- Key must be unique constraint enforced at database level
- Value field flexible to support multiple data types
- Category field for logical grouping
- Audit trail with created/updated timestamps

### Frontend Integration Requirements
[Source: Story 1.3-1.5 frontend patterns, authentication context]

**Existing Frontend Structure:**
- React Router setup with role-based protection
- Authentication context with role checking
- Dashboard page with admin navigation structure
- Protected route components for role-based access
- Shared TypeScript types and API service patterns

**Settings Management UI Requirements:**
- Admin interface accessible from Content Developer dashboard
- Settings listing with search, filter, and category grouping
- Create/edit forms with data type-specific controls
- Confirmation dialogs for delete operations
- Integration with existing UI theme and components
- Category-based organization and filtering

### Technology Stack Integration
[Source: Story 1.1-1.5 dependencies, NestJS/React setup]

**Backend Dependencies Available:**
- NestJS module structure supports admin modules
- TypeORM for entity and database management
- Validation pipes and decorators established
- Role-based guards from authentication story
- Error handling patterns from existing modules

**Frontend Dependencies Available:**
- React Router for admin route management
- Authentication context for role checking
- API service patterns from previous admin implementations
- Form validation libraries and UI components
- State management for settings data

### Testing Standards

**Settings Management Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for settings service CRUD operations
- Integration tests for API endpoints with role checking
- Frontend component testing for all user interactions
- Role-based access control validation
- Settings data type validation testing
- Search and filtering functionality testing

**Integration Testing:**
- Settings creation and retrieval by system components
- Role permission boundary testing
- Database constraint validation (unique keys)
- API error handling verification
- Data type conversion and validation testing

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 1.1-1.5 completion]

**Completed Infrastructure:**
- Complete database schema foundation
- TypeORM entities with proper relationships
- Backend NestJS application with admin module patterns
- Frontend React application with role-based routing
- Authentication system with Content Developer permissions

**Integration Points:**
- Admin module patterns established in previous stories
- Authentication guards available for endpoint protection
- Frontend admin navigation structure established
- Role-based access control patterns implemented
- CRUD patterns from Location and Trainer management stories

**Key Learnings from Previous Stories:**
- CRUD module structure patterns proven successful
- Role-based access control implementation patterns established
- Frontend admin interface patterns ready for reuse
- Search and pagination patterns available
- TypeORM entity patterns and validation established

### System Settings Categories and Default Values

**Suggested Categories:**
- **General**: Application name, default timezone, date formats
- **Email**: SMTP settings, notification preferences, email templates
- **AI**: API keys, model configurations, generation parameters
- **Security**: Session timeouts, password policies, access controls
- **UI**: Default pagination limits, theme settings, dashboard preferences
- **Session**: Default session duration, capacity limits, reminder settings
