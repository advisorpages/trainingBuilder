2. Page includes a hero section with headline, subheadline, and prominent registration form
3. Registration form captures name, email, and "referred by" field

6. Page is accessible via direct URL (/sessions/{session-id}) and from homepage session cards
7. Page is fully responsive and optimized for mobile sharing
8. Page includes SEO metadata for social sharing
9. Registration form validates inputs and shows success/error states

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
Story 5.1 established the public homepage with session cards linking to these dynamic pages. The registration form built here will feed into the two-stage registration system (Stories 5.3-5.4).

**Data Models:**
- Sessions table with full session details including AI-generated copy [Source: architecture.md#feature-tables]
- GET /sessions/{id} endpoint provides complete session data [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]
- POST /sessions/{id}/register endpoint for capturing registrations [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]
- Session fields: title, description, start_time, end_time, location_id, trainer_id, status [Source: architecture.md#database-schema]

**API Specifications:**
- GET /sessions/{id}: Public endpoint returning single published session with related data
- POST /sessions/{id}/register: Public registration endpoint capturing name, email, referred_by
- Response includes location details, trainer information, and AI-generated promotional content
- Registration endpoint stores data in registrations table for webhook sync [Source: architecture.md#feature-tables]

**Component Specifications:**
- React SPA with TypeScript following established patterns [Source: architecture.md#high-level-architecture]
- Dynamic routing with session ID parameter handling
- Responsive design matching public homepage styling patterns
- Form components following existing UI patterns from authenticated areas

**File Locations:**
- Session page component: packages/frontend/src/pages/SessionDetailPage.tsx
- Registration form component: packages/frontend/src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx
- Session content sections: packages/frontend/src/components/SessionContent.tsx
- Routing configuration: packages/frontend/src/App.tsx (add new route)
- Shared types: packages/shared/src/types/Session.ts, Registration.ts

**Technical Constraints:**
- Template-driven pages with clean, readable, shareable design [Source: prd user-interface-design-goals]
- Landing page structure: hero section with headline/subheadline and registration form [Source: appflow.txt]
- AI-generated promotional copy integration from session creation workflow
- Two-stage registration system preparation for webhook sync in subsequent stories
- Mobile-first responsive design for sharing capability

**Integration Points:**
- Links from homepage session cards (Story 5.1)
- Registration data flows to Stories 5.3-5.4 for webhook processing
- AI-generated content from Epic 2 session creation workflow
- Session status from Epic 3 publishing workflow

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for SessionDetailPage component rendering and data fetching
- Integration tests for registration form submission and validation
- End-to-end tests for complete user journey from homepage to registration
- Social sharing and SEO metadata validation testing
- Responsive design testing across device sizes
- Form validation and error state testing

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Valid session ID loads complete session page with all content sections
- Invalid session ID shows 404 error page
- Registration form validation works correctly
- Registration submission success/error flows
- Social sharing metadata appears correctly
- Mobile responsive layout functions properly
