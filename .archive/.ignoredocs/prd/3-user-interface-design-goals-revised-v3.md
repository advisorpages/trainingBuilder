# 3. User Interface Design Goals (Revised v3)

## Overall UX Vision (MVP)
The user experience will be **efficient, intuitive, and clean**. The goal is to deliver a stable and performant application that empowers users to create content quickly, using modern and highly usable interface patterns.

## Key Interaction Paradigms (MVP)
*   **The Worksheet:** Session creation will take place on a single-page "worksheet." This layout will provide a form for data entry alongside a live preview that updates in real-time (on desktop) or in a separate tab (on mobile).
*   **The Dynamic Grid:** The dashboard will present session and incentive cards in a dynamic grid layout (i.e., "Masonry"). This provides a more engaging and spatial feel than a standard list, while remaining clean and performant.
*   **Dynamic Content Pages:** Public-facing content will be presented on clean, readable, and shareable template-driven pages.

## Core Screens and Views
*   Public Homepage
*   Login Screen
*   Authenticated Dashboard (Dynamic Grid)
*   Creation Screen (The Worksheet)
*   Dynamic Detail Page
*   Admin screens

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

## Branding (MVP)
The initial design will use a clean, neutral, and modern theme that can be easily adapted once a formal style guide is provided.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be a responsive web app, designed with a mobile-first approach.

## Future Vision: Thematic Enhancements
While the MVP will be visually clean, a key goal for a future version is to enhance these layouts with a more tactile and engaging visual theme (the "Creator's Workshop"). This post-MVP effort would focus on adding textures, more expressive typography, and other creative elements to the established "Worksheet" and "Dynamic Grid" patterns.
