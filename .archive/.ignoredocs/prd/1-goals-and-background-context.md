# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals
*   Increase attendance at training and event sessions.
*   Improve the efficiency of creating and promoting sessions for the leadership team.
*   Enable users to quickly understand the value of a session and why they should attend.
*   Generate compelling content that encourages users to share it with others.
*   Streamline the process of creating high-quality event and training "sessions".

## Background Context
A significant amount of time is spent planning training sessions, which leaves little time for effective promotion, resulting in low attendance. The proposed application will provide an intuitive, mobile-first platform that empowers leadership and content creators to generate high-quality training and event sessions in minutes. It will leverage a wizard-style interface and AI to generate professional promotional copy, create excitement, and clearly communicate the value of attending.
