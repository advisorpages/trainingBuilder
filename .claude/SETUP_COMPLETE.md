# ‚úÖ Hybrid Development Setup Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-06

---

## What Was Done

### 1. üìù Documentation Created

- **`.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - Main instruction file for Claude Code
  - Defines hybrid workflow as the standard
  - Explains where code lives and how changes work
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Clear instructions on what NOT to suggest

- **`.claude/CHEATSHEET.md`** - Quick command reference
  - Correct vs incorrect commands
  - Diagnostic flows
  - Common operations

- **`DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Comprehensive development guide
  - Full setup instructions
  - Both workflow options documented
  - Architecture overview
  - Testing, troubleshooting, database management

- **`README.md`** - Updated with hybrid workflow
  - Quick start now shows hybrid approach first
  - References DEVELOPMENT.md for details

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Helper Scripts

- **`scripts/dev-local.sh`** - Automated setup script
  - Checks for Docker
  - Creates .env if missing
  - Starts database
  - Shows next steps clearly

  **Usage:**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/dev-local.sh
  ```

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Updates

- **`packages/backend/.env.example`** - Updated with correct port (5433)
- **`packages/backend/.env`** - Updated to use port 5433 for local development

### 4. üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Location Edit Error Fixed:**
  - Updated `UpdateLocationDto` to properly extend `CreateLocationDto` with `PartialType`
  - Added data cleaning in frontend to convert empty strings to `undefined`
  - This should fix the 400 error when editing locations

---

## How to Start Development Now

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Run the helper script
./scripts/dev-local.sh

# 2. In a new terminal, start backend
cd packages/backend && npm run start:dev

# 3. In another new terminal, start frontend
cd packages/frontend && npm run dev
```

### Manual Start

```bash
# Terminal 1: Database
docker-compose up database

# Terminal 2: Backend
cd packages/backend && npm run start:dev

# Terminal 3: Frontend
cd packages/frontend && npm run dev
```

## What Changed for Claude Code

### Before (Confusing)
- Claude would suggest `npm run dev` (full Docker)
- Claude would suggest `docker-compose logs backend` (backend not in Docker!)
- Claude wouldn't know where code changes go
- Hard to debug errors in containers

### After (Clear)
- Claude reads `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` in every conversation
- Claude knows to use hybrid workflow by default
- Claude suggests correct commands for local development
- Claude knows where to look for errors (terminal output, not Docker logs)

---

## Testing the Setup

### 1. Start Services

```bash
# Start database
docker-compose up database

# Start backend (new terminal)
cd packages/backend && npm run start:dev

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd packages/frontend && npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Check services are running
lsof -i :3001  # Should show backend (node)
lsof -i :3000  # Should show frontend (node)
docker ps      # Should show only database

# Access the app
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: http://localhost:3001
```

### 3. Test the Location Edit Fix

1. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Locations
2. Click "Edit" on a location
3. Make a change
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Should work without 400 error!

## Key Files for Claude Code

Claude Code will automatically read these files in future conversations:

1. **`.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** - Main workflow instructions
2. **`.claude/CHEATSHEET.md`** - Quick reference
3. **`.claude/settings.local.json`** - Permissions (already existed)

These files ensure Claude Code remembers:
- Use hybrid development by default
- Don't suggest Docker commands unless asked
- Check local terminals for errors, not Docker logs
- Know where code lives and how changes apply

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start the services** using the hybrid workflow
2. **Test the location edit** to confirm the bug is fixed
3. **Continue developing** - Claude Code will now suggest the correct workflow
4. **Reference DEVELOPMENT.md** for detailed guides on migrations, testing, etc.
