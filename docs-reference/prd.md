# Leadership Training App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals
*   Increase attendance at training and event sessions.
*   Improve the efficiency of creating and promoting sessions for the leadership team.
*   Enable users to quickly understand the value of a session and why they should attend.
*   Generate compelling content that encourages users to share it with others.
*   Streamline the process of creating high-quality event and training "sessions".

### Background Context
A significant amount of time is spent planning training sessions, which leaves little time for effective promotion, resulting in low attendance. The proposed application will provide an intuitive, mobile-first platform that empowers leadership and content creators to generate high-quality training and event sessions in minutes. It will leverage a wizard-style interface and AI to generate professional promotional copy, create excitement, and clearly communicate the value of attending.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals (Revised v3)

### Overall UX Vision (MVP)
The user experience will be **efficient, intuitive, and clean**. The goal is to deliver a stable and performant application that empowers users to create content quickly, using modern and highly usable interface patterns.

### Key Interaction Paradigms (MVP)
*   **The Worksheet:** Session creation will take place on a single-page "worksheet." This layout will provide a form for data entry alongside a live preview that updates in real-time (on desktop) or in a separate tab (on mobile).
*   **The Dynamic Grid:** The dashboard will present session and incentive cards in a dynamic grid layout (i.e., "Masonry"). This provides a more engaging and spatial feel than a standard list, while remaining clean and performant.
*   **Dynamic Content Pages:** Public-facing content will be presented on clean, readable, and shareable template-driven pages.

### Core Screens and Views
*   Public Homepage
*   Login Screen
*   Authenticated Dashboard (Dynamic Grid)
*   Creation Screen (The Worksheet)
*   Dynamic Detail Page
*   Admin screens

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

### Branding (MVP)
The initial design will use a clean, neutral, and modern theme that can be easily adapted once a formal style guide is provided.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be a responsive web app, designed with a mobile-first approach.

### Future Vision: Thematic Enhancements
While the MVP will be visually clean, a key goal for a future version is to enhance these layouts with a more tactile and engaging visual theme (the "Creator's Workshop"). This post-MVP effort would focus on adding textures, more expressive typography, and other creative elements to the established "Worksheet" and "Dynamic Grid" patterns.

---
## 4. Technical Assumptions (Revised v2)

### Proposed Technology Stack
*   **Frontend:** React (using Vite for tooling) with TypeScript.
*   **Backend:** Node.js (using NestJS framework) with TypeScript.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL.

### Development & Deployment Strategy
Development will be done locally using a Docker Compose setup to mirror the production environment. This ensures consistency across all development, staging, and production environments. The final application will be deployed as Docker containers to a remote server.

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
A monorepo is recommended to simplify dependency management and code sharing.

### Service Architecture: Monolith
A monolithic architecture is recommended for the MVP to reduce complexity.

### Testing Requirements: Unit & Integration Tests
The strategy will include Unit Tests for isolated components and Integration Tests for interactions between system parts.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
*   The application will be deployed to a cloud provider (TBD).
*   API documentation for third-party services (such as `qr-cloud`) will be sourced from the Context7 library server. The library ID for the QR code service is `/websites/qrcodes_at_api-documentation`.
