# Changelog

## 2025-09-25

- Realigned `SessionForm` unit and integration specs with the refreshed session builder UI, including hoisted service mocks, realistic fixtures, and updated validation expectations.
- Modernized authentication integration and context tests to mirror the current `AuthProvider` API, hoisting the auth service mock and asserting navigation/token handling flows.
- Added accessible labels and copy adjustments to `SessionMetadataForm`, updating related tests to expect the new "Save Now"/"Saving..." text and resilient modal button queries.
- Removed obsolete AI topic enhancement mock scaffolding and unused placeholder suite to keep the spec focused on real validation behavior.
